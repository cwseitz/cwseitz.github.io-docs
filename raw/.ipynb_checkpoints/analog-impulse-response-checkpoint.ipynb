    "\n",
    "In signal processing, the impulse response, or impulse response function (IRF), of a dynamic system is its output when presented with a brief input signal, called an impulse. By definition, the output for an arbitrary input sinal is equivalent to the convolution of the input with the IRF. If we let $h(t)$ be the IRF then we can predict the output as\n",

    "V_{out}(t) = V_{in}(t) * h(t) = \\int_{0}^{T} V_{in}(t)h(t)dt \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful property of the IRF is that its Fourier transform is the frequency reponse of the system - the transfer function. \n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "This property can be very useful if we already know the impulse response and would like to find the transfer function. Ultimately, if we know the impulse response we know pretty much everything we need to know - practically speaking. Let's begin with an RC circuit. If we are probing the RC circuit's capcitor, then the general prescription begins with writing down KVL and KCL: \n",

    "which only differs by a phase from our original solution. Another route to finding the impulse response would involve taking the inverse fourier transform of the previously found transfer function. This path is rocky however, the integral faced usually requires a table lookup of some kind. "
