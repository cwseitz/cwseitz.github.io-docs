    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The C programming language was first developed in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie a Bell Labs. The language was inspired by its predecessor B and eventually would be standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in the 1980s. The C programming language is a relatively low-level programming language which means that, as the programmer, you are required to do most of the leg work that is done automatically by higher level languages like Python. Practically speaking, we have to take memory management into our own hands when programming in C. This makes it very easy to shoot yourself in the foot as the programmer, but it also allows you program just about anything. This is by no means a comprehensive guide; it is only meant to be a rough overview of the language. The C Programming Language textbook is a great resources if you want to learn the ins and outs of the language.\n",

    "# Hello World\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the hello world program in C. First, we must import the header file stdio.h, which handles basic input and output from the keyboard and display, respectively. Then we define the function main() which is required in every C program. In C, we are given the option of including the return type of the program before the function name but if our function does not return anything we can omit this. Lastly, we make a function call to *printf()*, where the f stands for format. This is the standard function used for printing to the console and we will see of an example of formatting in the next section. "

    "# Defining variables\n",
    "\n",
    " The first instance of this that we will encounter is in the definition of variables and their data types. This comes down to what is called *static typing* and *dynamic typing*  and there is a nice thread on this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517582/what-is-the-difference-between-statically-typed-and-dynamically-typed-languages), but the tl;dr version is just that statically typed languages, like C, require the programmer to explicitly specify the data type of a particular variable when it is defined. Dynamically typed languages, like Python, have a system for inferring the type of a variable. Let's see this in action by creating a Farhenheit-Celsius table."

When defining user functions in C, we have to use a *function prototype* which is typically one line of code that includes three things: the function's return type, name, and arguments.

    "As you can see, we can assign the address of a to the pointer b. Then, we can copy what is contained in a to another variable c by using the indirection operator. After that, we modify a using the same operator, keeping c intact. Moving on, pointers become especially important when passing variables to a function you want to modify the original variables. In C, arguments are passed to functions *by value* meaning that when you pass, say, an integer to a function you pass only a *copy* of that integer to the function. Therefore, the function has no way of modifying the variable itself. There is a good example of how to reconcile this issue with pointers in the C Programming Language textbook. We will define a function swap(), which will take to variables and swap their values. First, we will try it the wrong way and then we will show how pointers make it work correctly. \n"

If their request can be fulfilled, n is added to the pointer allocp and allocp - n is returned so the user has the starting point for their block of memory. Recall that allocp is a global variable so successive calls to alloc() will affect allocp permanently. Finally, afree() can be used to free memory beyond a memory location p. It does this by simply reassigning the pointer allocp to the memory location beyond which memory should be freed. These functions are implemented in the standard library (but more robustly) as malloc() and free()."
