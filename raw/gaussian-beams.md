### The Paraxial Approximation

A paraxial beam is one in which the direction of propagation is limited to directions within a small angle to a cartesian axis. If we assume the beam is propagating along the z-direction and is polarized along the x-direction, we can write

\begin{equation*}
E(r,t) = \psi(r)e^{-i(kz-\omega t)}\hat{x}
\end{equation*}

where $\psi(r)$ is an unknown spatial function that defines the shape of the beam. By plugging in our hypothetical solution to the Helmholtz equation, we discover the paraxial Helmholtz equation

\begin{equation*}
\nabla_{\perp}^{2}\psi(r) - 2ik\partial_{z}\psi(r) = 0
\end{equation*}
