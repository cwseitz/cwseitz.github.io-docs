All documents should be stored in **cwseitz.github.io/docs/subject** under
a directory named with the same rootname as the document itself.
Any additional renderings should also be stored there.

To take advantage of the maturity of LaTeX relative to
most HTML-based math rendering tools e.g., MathJax
and the ability to create reusable LaTeX markup,
all posts will be rendered as PDF. For situations where it is 
unecessary to write an entire PDF (such as writing a coding cheatsheet),
you can render jupyter notebooks as HTML

```bash
nbconvert --to html XXX.ipynb
```
