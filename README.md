All documents should be stored in **cwseitz.github.io/docs** under
a directory named with the same rootname as the document itself 
Any additional renderings should also be stored there

For example, to render a .tex file as .pdf, enter cwseitz.github.io/docs/DOCNAME directory and run

```bash
latexpdf --interaction=nonstopmode DOCNAME.tex
```

To take advantage of the maturity of LaTeX w.r.t
most HTML-based math rendering tools e.g. MathJax
and the ability to create reusable LaTeX markup,
all posts will be rendered as PDF for reading 
purposes. 

Forcing yourself to write entire documents
encourages incorporation of smaller ideas 
into a larger work
