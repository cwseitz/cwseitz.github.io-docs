Every file such as pdf or md to be displayed on the page is a *document* 

All documents should be stored in **cwseitz.github.io/docs** under
a directory named with the same rootname as the document itself 
Any additional renderings should also be stored there

For example, to render a .tex file as pdf, enter the documents directory and run

latexpdf --interaction=nonstopmode DOCNAME.tex

###Notes

To take advantage of the maturity of LaTeX w.r.t
most HTML-based math rendering tools e.g. MathJax
and the ability to create reusable LaTeX markup,
all posts will be rendered as PDF for reading 
purposes. 

If the source needs to be copied, that can be done
by linking to the appropriate GitHub repository

Since most code written in the future will be 
proprietary, writing whitepapers with latex is 
the best choice

If necessary, you can build pdf2htmlEX and
convert the pdf to HTML format in the future

Forcing yourself to write entire documents
encourages incorporation of smaller ideas 
into a larger work
