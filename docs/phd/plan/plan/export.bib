   abstract = {IFN-induction of the CIITA (class II transactivator) promoter (pIV) requires Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), a chromatin-remodeling enzyme. However, the events that lead to pIV activation are only partially understood, and the point at which BRG1 acts is unknown. The first IFN-induced event triggers nuclear translocation of STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1), which binds IFN-responsive promoters. BRG1 is recruited after activator binding at several other inducible loci, and STAT family members are known to bind BRG1, suggesting that BRG1 might act downstream of STAT1. Here, we delineate a comprehensive view of factor assembly and detailed histone modifications at pIV and show that all events, even STAT1 binding, require BRG1 at CIITA pIV and other IFN-target promoters. Recruitment of IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3) [STAT1STAT2IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9)] to several IFN-responsive promoters is also BRG1-dependent. In contrast, constitutive BRG1 association at IFN targets is STAT1-independent. Furthermore, BRG1 is required for IFN-induced restriction enzyme and DNase I accessibility at promoters. Thus, BRG1 has an apical role in cytokine-induced promoter assembly, acting upstream of STAT complexes at multiple IFN target loci. BRG1-associated factor chromatin interferon SWISNF},

In this review, we begin by introducing interferon (IFN) and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway to highlight features that impact ISG production. Next, we describe ways in which ISGs both enhance innate pathogen-sensing capabilities and negatively regulate signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway. Several ISGs that directly inhibit virus infection are described with an emphasis on those that impact early and late stages of the virus life cycle. Finally, we describe ongoing efforts to identify and characterize antiviral ISGs, and we provide a forward-looking perspective on the ISG landscape. © 2014 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Quantitative estimation of the regulatory relationship between transcription factors and genes is a fundamental stepping stone when trying to develop models of cellular processes. Recent experimental high-throughput techniques, such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) provide important information about the architecture of the regulatory networks in the cell. However, it is very difficult to measure the concentration levels of transcription factor proteins and determine their regulatory effect on gene transcription. It is therefore an important computational challenge to infer these quantities using gene expression data and network architecture data. Results: We develop a probabilistic state space model that allows genome-wide inference of both transcription factor protein concentrations and their effect on the transcription rates of each target gene from microarray data. We use variational inference techniques to learn the model parameters and perform posterior inference of protein concentrations and regulatory strengths. The probabilistic nature of the model also means that we can associate credibility intervals to our estimates, as well as providing a tool to detect which binding events lead to significant regulation. We demonstrate our model on artificial data and on two yeast datasets in which the network structure has previously been obtained using ChIP data. Predictions from our model are consistent with the underlying biology and offer novel quantitative insights into the regulatory structure of the yeast cell. © 2006 Oxford University Press.},

   abstract = {Quantitative tracking of particle motion using live-cell imaging is a powerful approach to understanding the mechanism of transport of biological molecules, organelles, and cells. However, inferring complex stochastic motion models from single-particle trajectories in an objective manner is nontrivial due to noise from sampling limitations and biological heterogeneity. Here, we present a systematic Bayesian approach to multiple-hypothesis testing of a general set of competing motion models based on particle mean-square displacements that automatically classifies particle motion, properly accounting for sampling limitations and correlated noise while appropriately penalizing model complexity according to Occam's Razor to avoid over-fitting. We test the procedure rigorously using simulated trajectories for which the underlying physical process is known, demonstrating that it chooses the simplest physical model that explains the observed data. Further, we show that computed model probabilities provide a reliability test for the downstream biological interpretation of associated parameter values. We subsequently illustrate the broad utility of the approach by applying it to disparate biological systems including experimental particle trajectories from chromosomes, kinetochores, and membrane receptors undergoing a variety of complex motions. This automated and objective Bayesian framework easily scales to large numbers of particle trajectories, making it ideal for classifying the complex motion of large numbers of single molecules and cells from high-throughput screens, as well as single-cell-, tissue-, and organism-level studies. © 2012 by the Biophysical Society.},

For example, coregulated genes in several species have been shown to colocalize in space despite being far away on the DNA sequence. In this manuscript, we present a new, to our knowledge, method to model the three-dimensional structure of the chromosome in live cells based on DNA-DNA interactions measured in high-throughput chromosome conformation capture experiments and genome architecture mapping. Our approach incorporates a polymer model and directly uses the contact probabilities measured in high-throughput chromosome conformation capture experiments and genome architecture mapping experiments rather than estimates of average distances between genomic loci. Specifically, we model the chromosome as a Gaussian polymer with harmonic interactions and extract the coupling coefficients best reproducing the experimental contact probabilities. In contrast to existing methods, we give an exact expression of the contact probabilities at thermodynamic equilibrium. The Gaussian effective model reconstructed with our method reproduces experimental contacts with high accuracy. We also show how Brownian dynamics simulations of our reconstructed Gaussian effective model can be used to study chromatin organization and possibly give some clue about its dynamics.},

   abstract = {The phase separation occurring in a system of mutually interacting proteins that can bind on specific sites of a chromatin fiber is investigated here. This is achieved by means of extensive molecular dynamics simulations of a simple polymer model that includes regulatory proteins as interacting spherical particles. Our interest is particularly focused on the role played by phase separation in the formation of molecule aggregates that can join distant regulatory elements, such as gene promoters and enhancers, along the DNA. We find that the overall equilibrium state of the system resulting from the mutual interplay between binding molecules and chromatin can lead, under suitable conditions that depend on molecules concentration, molecule-molecule, and molecule-DNA interactions, to the formation of phase-separated molecular clusters, allowing robust contacts between regulatory sites. Vice versa, the presence of regulatory sites can promote the phase-separation process. Different dynamical regimes can generate the enhancer-promoter contact, either by cluster nucleation at binding sites or by bulk spontaneous formation of the mediating cluster to which binding sites are successively attracted. The possibility that such processes can explain experimental live-cell imaging data measuring distances between regulatory sites during time is also discussed.},

The solution of the CME contains extremely useful information that can be compared to experimental data in order to improve the quantitative understanding of biochemical reaction networks within the cell. However, this solution is costly to compute as it requires integrating an enormous system of differential equations that grows exponentially with the number of chemical species. To address this issue, we introduce a novel multiple-sinks Finite State Projection algorithm that approximates the CME with an adaptive sequence of reduced-order models with an effecient parallelization based on MPI.

   abstract = {Enhancers are key DNA elements that regulate gene transcription by activating promoters in eukaryotes. Many potential mechanistic models have been proposed to account for enhancer-promoter communication, including the formation of the condensed enhancer-promoter clusterings that may result from liquid-liquid phase separation. However, the detailed kinetic mechanisms by which condensates may mediate enhancer-promoter contacts remain unclear. Here, we characterized enhancer-promoter communication in condensates using a self-avoiding polymer chain model under several possible spatial constraints. When the chain was confined to the spherical surface or interior, we discovered a distinct relationship between average end-to-end distance and contour length, as well as a distinct distribution of end-to-end distance. Experimental molecular tracking data showed strong preference in support of the spherical surface confinement hypothesis. Based on such observation, we proposed a novel enhancer-promoter communication model in which enhancers dynamically “kiss” promoters along the surface of transcriptional condensate. The theoretical results may guide future experiments, as researchers continue to elucidate the regulation dynamics of gene expression. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

We find that recurrent cellular neighborhoods involving tumor, immune, and stromal cells change significantly along a progression axis involving precursor states, melanoma in situ, and invasive tumor. Hallmarks of immunosuppression are already detectable in precursor regions. When tumors become locally invasive, a consolidated and spatially restricted suppressive environment forms along the tumor-stromal boundary. This environment is established by cytokine gradients that promote expression of MHC-II and IDO1, and by PD1-PDL1-mediated cell contacts involving macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells. A few millimeters away, cytotoxic T cells synapse with melanoma cells in fields of tumor regression. Thus, invasion and immunoediting can coexist within a few millimeters of each other in a single specimen.},

Here, we report that diverse ADs form phase-separated condensates with the Mediator coactivator.

For the estrogen receptor (ER), a ligand-dependent activator, we show that estrogen enhances phase separation with Mediator, again linking phase separation with gene activation.

Using fluorescence insitu hybridization and computational models, we quantified the transcriptional activity of the proto-oncogene c-Fos with single mRNA accuracy at individual endogenous alleles. We showed that, during MAPK induction, the TF concentration modulates the burst frequency of c-Fos, whereas other bursting parameters remain mostly unchanged. By using synthetic TFs with TALE DNA-binding domains, we systematically altered different aspects of these bursts. Specifically, we linked the polymerase initiation frequency to the strength of the transactivation domain and the burst duration to the TF lifetime on the promoter.

However, using single-molecule imaging we find that CTCF binds chromatin much more dynamically than cohesin (~1-2 min vs. ~22 min residence time). Moreover, after unbinding, CTCF quickly rebinds another cognate site unlike cohesin for which the search process is long (~1 min vs. ~33 min). Thus, CTCF and cohesin form a rapidly exchanging ’dynamic complex’ rather than a typical stable complex.

   abstract = {SWI/SNF regulates growth control, differentiation and tumor suppression, yet few direct targets of this chromatin-remodeling complex have been identified in mammalian cells. We report that SWI/SNF is required for interferon (IFN)-γ induction of CIITA, the master regulator of major histocompatibility complex class II expression. Despite the presence of functional STAT1, IRF-1 and USF-1, activators implicated in CIITA expression, IFN-γ did not induce CIITA in cells lacking BRG1 and hBRM, the ATPase subunits of SWI/SNF. Reconstitution with BRG1, but not an ATPase-deficient version of this protein (K798R), rescued CIITA induction, and enhanced the rate of induction of the IFN-γ-responsive GBP-1 gene. Notably, BRG1 inhibited the CIITA promoter in transient transfection assays, underscoring the importance of an appropriate chromosomal environment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that BRG1 interacts directly with the endogenous CIITA promoter in an IFN-γ-inducible fashion, while in vivo DNase I footprinting and restriction enzyme accessibility assays showed that chromatin remodeling at this locus requires functional BRG1. These data provide the first link between a cytokine pathway and SWI/SNF, and suggest a novel role for this chromatin-remodeling complex in immune surveillance.},

   abstract = {Stochastic reaction network models are often used to explain and predict the dynamics of gene regulation in single cells. These models usually involve several parameters, such as the kinetic rates of chemical reactions, that are not directly measurable and must be inferred from experimental data. Bayesian inference provides a rigorous probabilistic framework for identifying these parameters by finding a posterior parameter distribution that captures their uncer-tainty. Traditional computational methods for solving inference problems such as Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on the classical Metropolis-Hastings algorithm involve numerous serial evaluations of the likelihood function, which in turn requires expensive forward solutions of the chemical master equation (CME). We propose an alternate approach based on a multifidelity extension of the sequential tempered Markov chain Monte Carlo (ST-MCMC) sam-pler. This algorithm is built upon sequential Monte Carlo and solves the Bayesian inference problem by decomposing it into a sequence of efficiently solved subproblems that gradually increase both model fidelity and the influence of the observed data. We reformulate the finite state projection (FSP) algorithm, a well-known method for solving the CME, to produce a hierarchy of surrogate master equations to be used in this multifidelity scheme. To determine the appro-priate fidelity, we introduce a novel information-theoretic criterion that seeks to extract the most information about the ultimate Bayesian posterior from each model in the hierarchy without inducing significant bias. This novel sampling scheme is tested with high-performance computing resources using biologically relevant problems.},

Many of the unique physico-chemical properties of chromatin-based phase condensates are harnessed by the cell to accomplish complex regulatory functions in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. Here, we survey key recent findings on the mechanistic roles of phase separation in regulating the organization and dynamics of chromatin-based molecular processes across length scales, packing states and intranuclear functions, with a particular emphasis on quantitative characterizations of these condensates enabled by advanced imaging-based approaches. By illuminating the complex interplay between chromatin and various chromatin-interacting molecular species mediated by phase separation, this review sheds light on an emerging multi-scale, multi-modal and multi-faceted landscape that hierarchically regulates the genome within the highly crowded and dynamic nuclear space. Moreover, deficiencies in existing studies also highlight the need for mechanism-specific criteria and multi-parametric approaches for the characterization of chromatin-based phase separation using complementary techniques and call for greater efforts to correlate the quantitative features of these condensates with their functional consequences in close-to-native cellular contexts.},

To approach this issue, we investigated genome-wide chromatin behavior under various transcriptional conditions in living human cells using single-nucleosome imaging. While transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is generally thought to need more open and dynamic chromatin, surprisingly, we found that active RNAPII globally constrains chromatin movements. RNAPII inhibition or its rapid depletion released the chromatin constraints and increased chromatin dynamics. Perturbation experiments of P-TEFb clusters, which are associated with active RNAPII, had similar results. Furthermore, chromatin mobility also increased in resting G0 cells and UV-irradiated cells, which are transcriptionally less active. Our results demonstrated that chromatin is globally stabilized by loose connections through active RNAPII, which is compatible with models of classical transcription factories or liquid droplet formation of transcription-related factors. Together with our computational modeling, we propose the existence of loose chromatin domain networks for various intra-/interchromosomal contacts via active RNAPII clusters/droplets.},

   abstract = {This article introduces the finite state projection (FSP) method for use in the stochastic analysis of chemically reacting systems. One can describe the chemical populations of such systems with probability density vectors that evolve according to a set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the chemical master equation (CME). Unlike Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) or τ leaping, the FSP directly solves or approximates the solution of the CME. If the CME describes a system that has a finite number of distinct population vectors, the FSP method provides an exact analytical solution. When an infinite or extremely large number of population variations is possible, the state space can be truncated, and the FSP method provides a certificate of accuracy for how closely the truncated space approximation matches the true solution. The proposed FSP algorithm systematically increases the projection space in order to meet prespecified tolerance in the total probability density error. For any system in which a sufficiently accurate FSP exists, the FSP algorithm is shown to converge in a finite number of steps. The FSP is utilized to solve two examples taken from the field of systems biology, and comparisons are made between the FSP, the SSA, and τ leaping algorithms. In both examples, the FSP outperforms the SSA in terms of accuracy as well as computational efficiency. Furthermore, due to very small molecular counts in these particular examples, the FSP also performs far more effectively than τ leaping methods. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

The method is a compact, computer-oriented, Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It should be particularly useful for modehng the transient behavior of well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular species participate in many highly coupled chemical reactions. For "ordinary" chemical systems in which fluctuations and correlations play no significant role, the method stands as an alternative to the traditional procedure of numerically solving the deterministic reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near chemical instabilities, where fluctuations and correlations may invalidate the deterministic equations, the method constitutes an efficient way of numerically examining the predictions of the stochastic master equation. Although fully equivalent to the spatially homogeneous master equation, the numerical simulation algorithm presented here is more directly based on a newly defined entity called "the reaction probability density function." The purpose of this article is to describe the mechanics of the simulation algorithm, and to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner its physical and mathematical validity; numerical applications to specific chemical systems will be presented in subsequent publications.},

Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive, making systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task.

This article gives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of state of the art methods.

Next, we discuss several approximation methods, including the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion, moment closure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid methods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and remaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of these methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight some of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of inference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent methods developed the literature.

Therefore, characterizing stochastic effects in biochemical systems is essential to understand the complex dynamics of living things. Mathematical idealizations of biochemically reacting systems must be able to capture stochastic phenomena. While robust theory exists to describe such stochastic models, the computational challenges in exploring these models can be a significant burden in practice since realistic models are analytically intractable. Determining the expected behaviour and variability of a stochastic biochemical reaction network requires many probabilistic simulations of its evolution. Using a biochemical reaction network model to assist in the interpretation of time-course data from a biological experiment is an even greater challenge due to the intractability of the likelihood function for determining observation probabilities. These computational challenges have been subjects of active research for over four decades. In this review, we present an accessible discussion of the major historical developments and state-of-the-art computational techniques relevant to simulation and inference problems for stochastic biochemical reaction network models. Detailed algorithms for particularly important methods are described and complemented with Matlabw implementations. As a result, this review provides a practical and accessible introduction to computational methods for stochastic models within the life sciences community.},

Specifically, we use a delay-adapted nonlinear Kalman filter within a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm to identify posterior probability distributions. Our method can be applied to time-series data on gene expression from single cells and is able to infer multiple parameters simultaneously. We apply it to published data on murine neural progenitor cells and show that it outperforms alternative methods. We further analyse how parameter uncertainty depends on the duration and time resolution of an imaging experiment, to make experimental design recommendations.

We find that, although ongoing transcription and local chromatin signatures are short-lived, the IFNγ-primed state stably propagates through at least 14 cell division cycles. Single-cell analysis reveals that memory is manifested by an increased probability of primed cells to engage in target gene expression, correlating with the strength of initial gene activation. Further, we find that strongly memorized genes tend to reside in genomic clusters and that long-term memory of these genes is locally restricted by cohesin.

We demonstrated that nucleosomes form compact domains with a peak diameter of ∼160 nm and move coherently in live cells. The heterochromatin-rich regions showed more domains and less movement. With cell differentiation, the domains became more apparent, with reduced dynamics. Furthermore, various perturbation experiments indicated that they are organized by a combination of factors, including cohesin and nucleosome-nucleosome interactions.

We used ORCA to study a Hox gene cluster in cryosectioned Drosophila embryos and labelled around 30 RNA species in parallel. We identified cell-type-specific physical borders between active and Polycomb-repressed DNA, and unexpected Polycomb-independent borders. Deletion of Polycomb-independent borders led to ectopic enhancer–promoter contacts, aberrant gene expression, and developmental defects.

While residue-specific phosphorylation has been mapped with exquisite spatial resolution along the 1D genome in a population of fixed cells using immunoprecipitation-based assays, the timing, kinetics, and spatial organization of phosphorylation along a single-copy gene have not yet been measured in living cells. Here, we achieve this by combining multi-color, single-molecule microscopy with fluorescent antibody-based probes that specifically bind to different phosphorylated forms of endogenous RNAP2 in living cells. Applying this methodology to a single-copy HIV-1 reporter gene provides live-cell evidence for heterogeneity in the distribution of RNAP2 along the length of the gene as well as Serine 5 phosphorylated RNAP2 clusters that remain separated in both space and time from nascent mRNA synthesis. Computational models determine that 5 to 40 RNAP2 cluster around the promoter during a typical transcriptional burst, with most phosphorylated at Serine 5 within 6 seconds of arrival and roughly half escaping the promoter in ~1.5 minutes. Taken together, our data provide live-cell support for the notion of efficient transcription clusters that transiently form around promoters and contain high concentrations of RNAP2 phosphorylated at Serine 5.},

Here using improved single-molecule RNA microscopy, we show that synthesis of HIV-1 RNA is achieved by groups of closely spaced polymerases, termed convoys, as opposed to single isolated enzymes. Convoys arise by a Mediator-dependent reinitiation mechanism, which generates a transient but rapid succession of polymerases initiating and escaping the promoter. During elongation, polymerases are spaced by few hundred nucleotides, and physical modelling suggests that DNA torsional stress may maintain polymerase spacing. We additionally observe that the HIV-1 promoter displays stochastic fluctuations on two time scales, which we refer to as multi-scale bursting. Each time scale is regulated independently: Mediator controls minute-scale fluctuation (convoys), while TBP-TATA-box interaction controls sub-hour fluctuations (long permissive/non-permissive periods). A cellular promoter also produces polymerase convoys and displays multi-scale bursting. We propose that slow, TBP-dependent fluctuations are important for phenotypic variability of single cells.},

PRISMR predicts higher-order chromatin structure from genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. Using the EPHA4 locus as a model, the effects of pathogenic SVs are predicted in silico and compared to Hi-C data generated from mouse limb buds and patient-derived fibroblasts. PRISMR deconvolves the folding complexity of the EPHA4 locus and identifies SV-induced ectopic contacts and alterations of 3D genome organization in homozygous or heterozygous states. We show that SVs can reconfigure topologically associating domains, thereby producing extensive rewiring of regulatory interactions and causing disease by gene misexpression.

The novel substitution is generalizable, yielding a palette of chemical dyes with improved quantum efficiencies that spans the UV and visible range.},

The OFF state has a lifetime in the range of 100 milliseconds to several seconds after irradiation with light intensities low enough to ensure minimal photodestruction. Either spontaneously or photoinduced on irradiation with a second laser wavelength, a sparse subset of fluorophores is reactivated and their positions are precisely determined. Repetitive activation, localization and deactivation allow a temporal separation of spatially unresolved structures in a reconstructed image.

Interferon-γ (IFNγ) is a cytokine that has both protumour and antitumour activities, suggesting that it may serve as a nexus for responsiveness to immunotherapy. Many cancer immunotherapies and chemotherapies induce IFNγ production by various cell types, including activated T cells and natural killer cells. Patients resistant to these therapies commonly have molecular aberrations in the IFNγ signalling pathway or express resistance molecules driven by IFNγ. Given that all nucleated cells can respond to IFNγ, the functional consequences of IFNγ production need to be carefully dissected on a cell-by-cell basis.

Recent experiments suggest that enhancers are anchored to the surfaces of condensates of transcription machinery and that the loop extrusion process enhances the transcription level of their target genes. Here, we theoretically study the polymer dynamics driven by the loop extrusion of the linker DNA between an enhancer and the promoter of its target gene to calculate the contact probability of the promoter to the transcription machinery in the condensate. Our theory predicts that when the loop extrusion process is active, the contact probability increases with increasing linker DNA length. This finding reflects the fact that the relaxation time, with which the promoter stays in proximity to the surface of the transcriptional condensate, increases as the length of the linker DNA increases. This contrasts the equilibrium case for which the contact probability between the promoter and the transcription machineries is smaller for longer linker DNA lengths.},

   abstract = {Problematic Humans are able to accurately track a moving object with a combi-nation of saccades and smooth eye movements. These movements allow us to align and stabilize the object on the fovea, thus en-abling high-resolution visual detection. When predictive informa-tion is available about target motion, anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements (aSPEM) are efficiently generated before target appearance, which reduce the typical sensorimotor delay between target motion onset and foveation. It is generally assumed that the role of anticipatory eye movements is to limit the behavioral impairment due to eye-to-target position and velocity mismatch. By manipulating the probability for target motion direction we were able to bias the direction and mean velocity of aSPEM, as mea-sured during a fixed duration gap before target ramp-motion onset. This suggests that probabilistic information may be used to inform the internal representation of motion prediction for the initiation of anticipatory movements [1]. However, such estimate may become particularly challenging in a dynamic context, where the probabilistic contingencies vary in time in an unpredictable way. In addition, whether and how the infor-mation processing underlying the buildup of aSPEM is linked to an explicit estimate of probabilities is unknown. Material and Method In order to answer these questions, we have set up an experi-ment comprising 3 blocks of 200 trials. For each trial, a tar-get makes either to the left or to the right, this direction being drawn from a Bernoulli process. The probability of this process varied in a piecewise-constant (that is, a step function varying be-tween 0 and 1), similarly to Meyniel et al. [2]. The occurence of these switches is itself drawn from a Bernoulli process of probability p switch = 1/40. We asked subjects to perform two tasks on different days :},

The reason for this discrepancy is not fully understood. One might argue that the randomness and complexity of biological systems are the main barriers to predictive understanding, but these issues are not unique to biology. Instead, we hypothesize that the specific shapes of rare single-molecule event distributions produce substantial yet overlooked challenges for biological models. We demonstrate why modern statistical tools to disentangle complexity and stochasticity, which assume normally distributed fluctuations or enormous datasets, do not apply to the discrete, positive, and nonsymmetric distributions that characterize mRNA fluctuations in single cells. As an example, we integrate single-molecule measurements and advanced computational analyses to explore mitogen-activated protein kinase induction of multiple stress response genes. Through systematic analyses of different metrics to compare the same model to the same data, we elucidate why standard modeling approaches yield nonpredictive models for single-cell gene regulation. We further explain how advanced tools recover precise, reproducible, and predictive understanding of transcription regulation mechanisms, including gene activation, polymerase initiation, elongation, mRNA accumulation, spatial transport, and decay.},

Analyses of the nucleosome–nucleosome correlation functions within these categories along with the density of vibrational modes show that the nucleosomes form dynamically correlated fluid regions (i.e., dynamic domains of fast and slow nucleosomes). Perturbed nucleosome dynamics by global histone acetylation or cohesin inactivation indicate that nucleosome–nucleosome interactions along with tethering of chromatin chains organize nucleosomes into fast and slow dynamic domains. A simple polymer model is introduced, which shows the consistency of this dynamic domain picture. Statistical analyses of single-nucleosome movement provide rich information on how chromatin is dynamically organized in a fluid manner in living cells.},

In equilibrium models, it is difficult to reconcile the reported short transcription factor (TF) residence times on the DNA with the high specificity of regulation. In nonequilibrium models, progress is difficult due to an explosion in the number of parameters. Here, we navigate this complexity by looking for minimal nonequilibrium enhancer models that yield desired regulatory phenotypes: low TF residence time, high specificity, and tunable cooperativity. We find that a single extra parameter, interpretable as the “linking rate,” by which bound TFs interact with Mediator components, enables our models to escape equilibrium bounds and access optimal regulatory phenotypes, while remaining consistent with the reported phenomenology and simple enough to be inferred from upcoming experiments. We further find that high specificity in nonequilibrium models is in a trade-off with gene-expression noise, predicting bursty dynamics-an experimentally observed hallmark of eukaryotic transcription. By drastically reducing the vast parameter space of nonequilibrium enhancer models to a much smaller subspace that optimally realizes biological function, we deliver a rich class of models that could be tractably inferred from data in the near future.},

   abstract = {IFN-γ induction of the CIITA (class II transactivator) promoter (pIV) requires Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), a chromatin-remodeling enzyme. However, the events that lead to pIV activation are only partially understood, and the point at which BRG1 acts is unknown. The first IFN-γ-induced event triggers nuclear translocation of STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1), which binds IFN-γ-responsive promoters. BRG1 is recruited after activator binding at several other inducible loci, and STAT family members are known to bind BRG1, suggesting that BRG1 might act downstream of STAT1. Here, we delineate a comprehensive view of factor assembly and detailed histone modifications at pIV and show that all events, even STAT1 binding, require BRG1 at CIITA pIV and other IFN-γ target promoters. Recruitment of IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3) [STAT1/STAT2/IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9)] to several IFN-α-responsive promoters is also BRG1-dependent. In contrast, constitutive BRG1 association at IFN targets is STAT1-independent. Furthermore, BRG1 is required for IFN-induced restriction enzyme and DNase I accessibility at promoters. Thus, BRG1 has an apical role in cytokine-induced promoter assembly, acting upstream of STAT complexes at multiple IFN target loci. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

   abstract = {Epigenetic memory for signal-dependent transcription has remained elusive. So far, the concept of epigenetic memory has been largely limited to cell-autonomous, preprogrammed processes such as development and metabolism. Here we show that IFNβ stimulation creates transcriptional memory in fibroblasts, conferring faster and greater transcription upon restimulation. The memory was inherited through multiple cell divisions and led to improved antiviral protection. Of ~2,000 IFNβ-stimulated genes (ISGs), about half exhibited memory, which we define as memory ISGs. The rest, designated nonmemory ISGs, did not show memory. Surprisingly, mechanistic analysis showed that IFN memory was not due to enhanced IFN signaling or retention of transcription factors on the ISGs. We demonstrated that this memory was attributed to accelerated recruitment of RNA polymerase II and transcription/chromatin factors, which coincided with acquisition of the histone H3.3 and H3K36me3 chromatin marks on memory ISGs. Similar memory was observed in bone marrow macrophages after IFNγ stimulation, suggesting that IFN stimulation modifies the shape of the innate immune response. Together, external signals can establish epigenetic memory in mammalian cells that imparts lasting adaptive performance upon various somatic cells.},

   abstract = {We use a chromosome-scale simulation to show that the preferential binding of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to regions high in histone methylation (specifically H3K9me3) results in phase segregation and reproduces features of the observed Hi-C contact map. Specifically, we perform Monte Carlo simulations with one computational bead per nucleosome and an H3K9me3 pattern based on published ChIP-seq signals. We implement a binding model in which HP1 preferentially binds to trimethylated histone tails and then oligomerizes to bridge together nucleosomes. We observe a phase reminiscent of heterochromatin—dense and high in H3K9me3—and another reminiscent of euchromatin—less dense and lacking H3K9me3. This segregation results in a plaid contact probability map that matches the general shape and position of published Hi-C data. Analysis suggests that a roughly 20-kb segment of H3K9me3 enrichment is required to drive segregation into the heterochromatic phase.},

@report{Sanchez2013a,
   abstract = {In individual cells, transcription is a random process obeying single-molecule kinetics. Often, it occurs in a bursty, intermittent manner. The frequency and size of these bursts affect the magnitude of temporal fluctuations in messenger RNA and protein content within a cell, creating variation or "noise" in gene expression. It is still unclear to what degree transcriptional kinetics are specific to each gene and determined by its promoter sequence. Alternative scenarios have been proposed, in which the kinetics of transcription are governed by cellular constraints and follow universal rules across the genome. Evidence from genome-wide noise studies and from systematic perturbations of promoter sequences suggest that both scenarios - namely gene-specific versus genome-wide regulation of transcription kinetics - may be present to different degrees in bacteria, yeast, and animal cells.},

We used live-cell superresolution and light-sheet imaging to study the organization and dynamics of the Mediator coactivator and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) directly. Mediator and Pol II each form small transient and large stable clusters in living embryonic stem cells. Mediator and Pol II are colocalized in the stable clusters, which associate with chromatin, have properties of phase-separated condensates, and are sensitive to transcriptional inhibitors. We suggest that large clusters of Mediator, recruited by transcription factors at large or clustered enhancer elements, interact with large Pol II clusters in transcriptional condensates in vivo.},

Yet during the past 15 years, a collection of observations compiled under the umbrella term ‘transcriptional bursting’ has received considerable interest. Direct visualization of the dynamics of discontinuous transcription has expanded our understanding of basic transcriptional mechanisms and their regulation and provides a real-time readout of gene activity during the life of a cell. In this review, we try to reconcile the different views of the transcriptional process emerging from studies of bursting, and how this work contextualizes the relative importance of different regulatory inputs to normal dynamic ranges of gene activity.},

In this article, we review recent statistical methods of extracting biophysical parameters from in vivo single-particle trajectories of loci to reconstruct chromatin reorganization in response to cellular stress such as DNA damage. We look at methods for analyzing both single locus and multiple loci tracked simultaneously and explain how to quantify and describe chromatin motion using a combination of extractable parameters. These parameters can be converted into information about chromatin dynamics and function. Furthermore, we discuss how the timescale of recurrent encounter between loci can be extracted and interpreted. We also discuss the effect of sampling rate on the estimated parameters. Finally, we review a polymer method to reconstruct chromatin structure using crosslinkers between chromatin sites. We list and refer to some software packages that are now publicly available to simulate polymer motion. To conclude, chromatin organization and dynamics can be reconstructed from locus trajectories and predicted based on polymer models.},
