abstract = {Motivation: Over the last decade, numerous methods have been developed for inference of regulatory networks from gene expression data. However, accurate and systematic evaluation of these methods is hampered by the difficulty of constructing adequate benchmarks and the lack of tools for a differentiated analysis of network predictions on such benchmarks.Results: Here, we describe a novel and comprehensive method for in silico benchmark generation and performance profiling of network inference methods available to the community as an open-source software called GeneNetWeaver (GNW). In addition to the generation of detailed dynamical models of gene regulatory networks to be used as benchmarks, GNW provides a network motif analysis that reveals systematic prediction errors, thereby indicating potential ways of improving inference methods. The accuracy of network inference methods is evaluated using standard metrics such as precision-recall and receiver operating characteristic curves. We show how GNW can be used to assess the performance and identify the strengths and weaknesses of six inference methods. Furthermore, we used GNW to provide the international Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) competition with three network inference challenges (DREAM3, DREAM4 and DREAM5). {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.

abstract = {PD-L1 and PD-L2 are ligands for the PD-1 immune inhibiting checkpoint that can be induced in tumors by interferon exposure, leading to immune evasion. This process is important for immunotherapy based on PD-1 blockade. We examined the specific molecules involved in interferon-induced signaling that regulates PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in melanoma cells. These studies revealed that the interferon-gamma-JAK1/JAK2-STAT1/STAT2/STAT3-IRF1 axis primarily regulates PD-L1 expression, with IRF1 binding to its promoter. PD-L2 responded equally to interferon beta and gamma and is regulated through both IRF1 and STAT3, which bind to the PD-L2 promoter. Analysis of biopsy specimens from patients with melanoma confirmed interferon signature enrichment and upregulation of gene targets for STAT1/STAT2/STAT3 and IRF1 in anti-PD-1-responding tumors. Therefore, these studies map the signaling pathway of interferon-gamma-inducible PD-1 ligand expression.},

abstract = {Stochasticity is a key characteristic of intracellular processes such as gene regulation and chemical signalling. Therefore, characterizing stochastic effects in biochemical systems is essential to understand the complex dynamics of living things. Mathematical idealizations of biochemically reacting systems must be able to capture stochastic phenomena. While robust theory exists to describe such stochastic models, the computational challenges in exploring these models can be a significant burden in practice since realistic models are analytically intractable. Determining the expected behaviour and variability of a stochastic biochemical reaction network requires many probabilistic simulations of its evolution. Using a biochemical reaction network model to assist in the interpretation of time-course data from a biological experiment is an even greater challenge due to the intractability of the likelihood function for determining observation probabilities. These computational challenges have been subjects of active research for over four decades. In this review, we present an accessible discussion of the major historical developments and state-of-the-art computational techniques relevant to simulation and inference problems for stochastic biochemical reaction network models. Detailed algorithms for particularly important methods are described and complemented with Matlabw implementations. As a result, this review provides a practical and accessible introduction to computational methods for stochastic models within the life sciences community.},

abstract = {In recent years, it has been experimentally established that transcription, a fundamental biological process that involves the synthesis of messenger RNA molecules from DNA templates, does not proceed continuously as was expected. Rather, it exhibits a distinct dynamic behavior of alternating between productive phases when RNA molecules are actively synthesized and inactive phases when there is no RNA production at all. The bimodal transcriptional dynamics is now confirmed to be present in most living systems. This phenomenon is known as transcriptional bursting and it attracts significant amounts of attention from researchers in different fields. However, despite multiple experimental and theoretical investigations, the microscopic origin and biological functions of the transcriptional bursting remain unclear. Here we discuss the recent developments in uncovering the underlying molecular mechanisms of transcriptional bursting and our current understanding of them. Our analysis presents a physicochemical view of the processes that govern transcriptional bursting in living cells.},

abstract = {A network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with global inhibitory feedback and under the influence of spatially correlated noise is studied. We calculate the spectral statistics of the network (power spectrum of the population activity, cross spectrum between spike trains of different neurons) as well as of a single neuron (power spectrum of spike train, cross spectrum between external noise and spike train) within the network. As shown by comparison with numerical simulations, our theory works well for arbitrary network size if the feedback is weak and the amount of external noise does not exceed that of the internal noise. By means of our analytical results we discuss the quality of the correlation-induced oscillation in a large network as a function of the transmission delay and the internal noise intensity. It is shown that the strongest oscillation is obtained in a system with zero internal noise and adiabatically long delay (i.e., the delay period is longer than any other time scale in the system). For a neuron with a strong intrinsic frequency, the oscillation becomes strongly anharmonic in the case of a long delay time. We also discuss briefly the kind of synchrony introduced by the feedback-induced oscillation. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The profile of transmembrane-channel expression in neurons is class dependent and a crucial determinant of neuronal dynamics. Here, a generalization of the experimentally verified exponential integrate-and-fire model is introduced that includes biophysical, nonlinear gated conductance-based currents, and a spike shape. A Fokker-Planck-based method is developed that allows for the rapid numerical calculation of steady-state and linear-response properties for recurrent networks of neurons with gating-variable dynamics slower than that of the voltage. This limit includes many cases of biological interest, particularly under in vivo conditions of high synaptic conductance. The utility of the method is illustrated by applying it to two biophysically detailed models adapted from the literature: an entorhinal layer-II cortical neuron and a neuron featuring both calcium-activated and voltage-activated spike-frequency-adaptation currents. The framework generalizes to networks comprised of different neuronal classes and so will allow for the modeling of emergent states in neural tissue at significantly increased levels of biological detail. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Networks of model neurons with balanced recurrent excitation and inhibition capture the irregular and asynchronous spiking activity reported in cortex. While mean-field theories of spatially homogeneous balanced networks are well understood, a mean-field analysis of spatially heterogeneous balanced networks has not been fully developed. We extend the analysis of balanced networks to include a connection probability that depends on the spatial separation between neurons. In the continuum limit, we derive that stable, balanced firing rate solutions require that the spatial spread of external inputs be broader than that of recurrent excitation, which in turn must be broader than or equal to that of recurrent inhibition. Notably, this implies that network models with broad recurrent inhibition are inconsistent with the balanced state. For finite size networks, we investigate the pattern-forming dynamics arising when balanced conditions are not satisfied. Our study highlights the new challenges that balanced networks pose for the spatiotemporal dynamics of complex systems.},

Here we show that the interaction of Hebbian homosynaptic plasticity with rapid non-Hebbian heterosynaptic plasticity is, when complemented with slower homeostatic changes and consolidation, sufficient for assembly formation and memory recall in a spiking recurrent network model of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In the model, assemblies were formed during repeated sensory stimulation and characterized by strong recurrent excitatory connections. Even days after formation, and despite ongoing network activity and synaptic plasticity, memories could be recalled through selective delay activity following the brief stimulation of a subset of assembly neurons. Blocking any component of plasticity prevented stable functioning as a memory network. Our modelling results suggest that the diversity of plasticity phenomena in the brain is orchestrated towards achieving common functional goals.},

abstract = {To build a catalog of peptides presented by breast cancer cells, we undertook systematic MHC class I immunoprecipitation followed by elution of MHC class I-loaded peptides in breast cancer cells. We determined the sequence of 3196 MHC class I ligands representing 1921 proteins from a panel of 20 breast cancer cell lines. After removing duplicate peptides, i.e., the same peptide eluted from more than one cell line, the total number of unique peptides was 2740. Of the unique peptides eluted, more than 1750 had been previously identified, and of these, sixteen have been shown to be immunogenic. Importantly, half of these immunogenic peptides were shared between different breast cancer cell lines. MHC class I binding probability was used to plot the distribution of the eluted peptides in accordance with the binding score for each breast cancer cell line. We also determined that the tested breast cancer cells presented 89 mutation-containing peptides and peptides derived from aberrantly translated genes, 7 of which were shared between four or two different cell lines. Overall, the high throughput identification of MHC class I-loaded peptides is an effective strategy for systematic characterization of cancer peptides, and could be employed for design of multi-peptide anticancer vaccines. Significance: By employing proteomic analyses of eluted peptides from breast cancer cells, the current study has built an initial HLA-I-typed antigen collection for breast cancer research. It was also determined that immunogenic epitopes can be identified using established cell lines and that shared immunogenic peptides can be found in different cancer types such as breast cancer and leukemia. Importantly, out of 3196 eluted peptides that included duplicate peptides in different cells 89 peptides either contained mutation in their sequence or were derived from aberrant translation suggesting that mutation-containing epitopes are on the order of 2–3{\%} in breast cancer cells. Finally, our results suggest that interfering with MHC class I function is one of the mechanisms of how tumor cells escape immune system attack.},

We presently characterize human beta cell responses to IFN$\alpha$ by combining ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and proteomics assays. The initial response to IFN$\alpha$ is characterized by chromatin remodeling, followed by changes in transcriptional and translational regulation. IFN$\alpha$ induces changes in alternative splicing (AS) and first exon usage, increasing the diversity of transcripts expressed by the beta cells. This, combined with changes observed on protein modification/degradation, ER stress and MHC class I, may expand antigens presented by beta cells to the immune system. Beta cells also up-regulate the checkpoint proteins PDL1 and HLA-E that may exert a protective role against the autoimmune assault. Data mining of the present multi-omics analysis identifies two compound classes that antagonize IFN$\alpha$ effects on human beta cells.},

abstract = {The organization of computations in networks of spiking neurons in the brain is still largely unknown, in particular in view of the inherently stochastic features of their firing activity and the experimentally observed trial-to-trial variability of neural systems in the brain. In principle there exists a powerful computational framework for stochastic computations, probabilistic inference by sampling, which can explain a large number of macroscopic experimental data in neuroscience and cognitive science. But it has turned out to be surprisingly difficult to create a link between these abstract models for stochastic computations and more detailed models of the dynamics of networks of spiking neurons. Here we create such a link and show that under some conditions the stochastic firing activity of networks of spiking neurons can be interpreted as probabilistic inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Since common methods for MCMC sampling in distributed systems, such as Gibbs sampling, are inconsistent with the dynamics of spiking neurons, we introduce a different approach based on non-reversible Markov chains that is able to reflect inherent temporal processes of spiking neuronal activity through a suitable choice of random variables. We propose a neural network model and show by a rigorous theoretical analysis that its neural activity implements MCMC sampling of a given distribution, both for the case of discrete and continuous time. This provides a step towards closing the gap between abstract functional models of cortical computation and more detailed models of networks of spiking neurons. {\textcopyright} 2011 Buesing et al.},

Transient gene activation can have a lasting effect even in the absence of ongoing transcription, known as long-term transcriptional memory. Here we explore the nature of the establishment and maintenance of interferon $\gamma$ (IFN$\gamma$)-induced priming of human cells. We find that, although ongoing transcription and local chromatin signatures are short-lived, the IFN$\gamma$-primed state stably propagates through at least 14 cell division cycles. Single-cell analysis reveals that memory is manifested by an increased probability of primed cells to engage in target gene expression, correlating with the strength of initial gene activation. Further, we find that strongly memorized genes tend to reside in genomic clusters and that long-term memory of these genes is locally restricted by cohesin. We define the duration, stochastic nature, and molecular mechanisms of IFN$\gamma$-induced transcriptional memory, relevant to understanding enhanced innate immune signaling.},

We investigate the coincidence detection properties of an integrate-and-fire neuron in dependence upon internal parameters and input statistics. In particular, we show how coincidence detection depends on the membrane time constant and the threshold. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is an optimal threshold for coincidence detection and that there is a broad range of near-optimal threshold values. Fine-tuning is not necessary.

Specifically, the responses of a population of neurons are interpreted as stochastic samples from the posterior distribution in a latent variable model. In addition to giving theoretical arguments supporting such a representational scheme, we provide simulations suggesting how some aspects of response variability might be understood in this framework.},

abstract = {Motivation: Quantitative estimation of the regulatory relationship between transcription factors and genes is a fundamental stepping stone when trying to develop models of cellular processes. Recent experimental high-throughput techniques, such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) provide important information about the architecture of the regulatory networks in the cell. However, it is very difficult to measure the concentration levels of transcription factor proteins and determine their regulatory effect on gene transcription. It is therefore an important computational challenge to infer these quantities using gene expression data and network architecture data. Results: We develop a probabilistic state space model that allows genome-wide inference of both transcription factor protein concentrations and their effect on the transcription rates of each target gene from microarray data. We use variational inference techniques to learn the model parameters and perform posterior inference of protein concentrations and regulatory strengths. The probabilistic nature of the model also means that we can associate credibility intervals to our estimates, as well as providing a tool to detect which binding events lead to significant regulation. We demonstrate our model on artificial data and on two yeast datasets in which the network structure has previously been obtained using ChIP data. Predictions from our model are consistent with the underlying biology and offer novel quantitative insights into the regulatory structure of the yeast cell. {\textcopyright} 2006 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {IRF1 is a transcription factor involved in interferon signaling and has been shown to harbor tumor suppressor activity. In order to comprehensively identify pathways regulated by IRF1, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massive-parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) to evaluate the gene targets of IRF1 genome-wide. We identified 17,416 total binding events in breast cancer cells. Functional categorization of the binding sites after IFN-gamma (interferon-gamma) treatment determined that 'apoptosis' or 'cell death' is the most enriched target process. Motif discovery analysis of the chromosomal regions bound by IRF1 identified a number of unique motifs correlated with apoptosis, DNA damage and immune processes. Analysis of GEO transcriptome data from IRF1-transduced cells or IFN-gamma treated fibroblasts indicates that IRF1-bound targets in IFN-treated cells are associated with a positive transcriptional response. Many of the enriched target genes from the expression analysis are associated with apoptosis.

abstract = {Gene expression dynamics, such as stochastic oscillations and aperiodic fluctuations, have been associated with cell fate changes in multiple contexts, including development and cancer. Single cell live imaging of protein expression with endogenous reporters is widely used to observe such gene expression dynamics. However, the experimental investigation of regulatory mechanisms underlying the observed dynamics is challenging, since these mechanisms include complex interactions of multiple processes, including transcription, translation and protein degradation. Here, we present a Bayesian method to infer kinetic parameters of oscillatory gene expression regulation using an auto-negative feedback motif with delay. Specifically, we use a delay-adapted nonlinear Kalman filter within a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm to identify posterior probability distributions. Our method can be applied to time-series data on gene expression from single cells and is able to infer multiple parameters simultaneously. We apply it to published data on murine neural progenitor cells and show that it outperforms alternative methods. We further analyse how parameter uncertainty depends on the duration and time resolution of an imaging experiment, to make experimental design recommendations. This work demonstrates the utility of parameter inference on time course data from single cells and enables new studies on cell fate changes and population heterogeneity.},

abstract = {The architecture of cortex is flexible, permitting neuronal networks to store recent sensory experiences as specific synaptic connectivity patterns. However, it is unclear how these patterns are maintained in the face of the high spike time variability associated with cortex. Here we demonstrate, using a large-scale cortical network model, that realistic synaptic plasticity rules coupled with homeostatic mechanisms lead to the formation of neuronal assemblies that reflect previously experienced stimuli. Further, reverberation of past evoked states in spontaneous spiking activity stabilizes, rather than erases, this learned architecture. Spontaneous and evoked spiking activity contains a signature of learned assembly structures, leading to testable predictions about the effect of recent sensory experience on spike train statistics. Our work outlines requirements for synaptic plasticity rules capable of modifying spontaneous dynamics and shows that this modification is beneficial for stability of learned network architectures.},

In particular, a state of asynchronous activity with low firing rates and low pairwise correlations emerges in sparsely connected networks. We apply linear response theory to evaluate the influence of detailed network structure on neuron dynamics. It turns out that pairwise correlations induced by direct and indirect network connections can be related to the matrix of direct linear interactions. Furthermore, we study the influence of the characteristics of the neuron model. Interpreting the reset as self-inhibition, we examine its influence, via the spectrum of single-neuron activity, on network autocorrelation functions and the overall correlation level. The neuron model also affects the form of interaction kernels and consequently the time-dependent correlation functions. We find that a linear instability of networks with Erd{\"{o}}s-R{\'{e}}nyi topology coincides with a global transition to a highly correlated network state.

abstract = {Primates can learn to recognize a virtually limitless number of visual objects. A candidate neural substrate for this adult plasticity is the inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Using a large stimulus set, we explored the impact that long-term experience has on the response properties of two classes of neurons in ITC: broad-spiking (putative excitatory) cells and narrow-spiking (putative inhibitory) cells. We found that experience increased maximum responses of putative excitatory neurons but had the opposite effect on maximum responses of putative inhibitory neurons, an observation that helps to reconcile contradictory reports regarding the presence and direction of this effect. In addition, we found that experience reduced the average stimulus-evoked response in both cell classes, but this decrease was much more pronounced in putative inhibitory units. This latter finding supports a potentially critical role of inhibitory neurons in detecting and initiating the cascade of events underlying adult neural plasticity in ITC. Woloszyn and Sheinberg show that long-term visual experience enhances activity of putative excitatory neurons in inferior temporal cortex but decreases global activity of putative inhibitory neurons. These findings help reconcile conflicting views of the influence of visual experience on activity in IT cortex. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) is a stochastic description of reaction-diffusion processes on a spatial lattice, assuming well mixing only on the length scale of the lattice. It is clear that, for the sake of consistency, the solution of the RDME of a chemical system should converge to the solution of the CME of the same system in the limit of fast diffusion: Indeed, this has been tacitly assumed in most literature concerning the RDME. We show that, in the limit of fast diffusion, the RDME indeed converges to a master equation but not necessarily the CME. We introduce a class of propensity functions, such that if the RDME has propensities exclusively of this class, then the RDME converges to the CME of the same system, whereas if the RDME has propensities not in this class, then convergence is not guaranteed. These are revealed to be elementary and nonelementary propensities, respectively. We also show that independent of the type of propensity, the RDME converges to the CME in the simultaneous limit of fast diffusion and large volumes. We illustrate our results with some simple example systems and argue that the RDME cannot generally be an accurate description of systems with nonelementary rates.},

abstract = {Functional interactions between neurons in vivo are often quantified by cross-correlation functions (CCFs) between their spike trains. It is therefore essential to understand quantitatively how CCFs are shaped by different factors, such as connectivity, synaptic parameters, and background activity. Here, we study the CCF between two neurons using analytical calculations and numerical simulations. We quantify the role of synaptic parameters, such as peak conductance, decay time, and reversal potential, and analyze how various patterns of connectivity influence CCF shapes. In particular, we find that the symmetry of the CCF distinguishes in general, but not always, the case of shared inputs between two neurons from the case in which they are directly synaptically connected. We systematically examine the influence of background synaptic inputs from the surrounding network that set the baseline firing statistics of the neurons and modulate their response properties. We find that variations in the background noise modify the amplitude of the cross-correlation function as strongly as variations of synaptic strength. In particular, we show that the postsynaptic neuron spiking regularity has a pronounced influence on CCF amplitude. This suggests an efficient and flexible mechanism for modulating functional interactions. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 Society for Neuroscience.},

abstract = {Problematic Humans are able to accurately track a moving object with a combi-nation of saccades and smooth eye movements. These movements allow us to align and stabilize the object on the fovea, thus en-abling high-resolution visual detection. When predictive informa-tion is available about target motion, anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements (aSPEM) are efficiently generated before target appearance, which reduce the typical sensorimotor delay between target motion onset and foveation. It is generally assumed that the role of anticipatory eye movements is to limit the behavioral impairment due to eye-to-target position and velocity mismatch. By manipulating the probability for target motion direction we were able to bias the direction and mean velocity of aSPEM, as mea-sured during a fixed duration gap before target ramp-motion onset. This suggests that probabilistic information may be used to inform the internal representation of motion prediction for the initiation of anticipatory movements [1]. However, such estimate may become particularly challenging in a dynamic context, where the probabilistic contingencies vary in time in an unpredictable way. In addition, whether and how the infor-mation processing underlying the buildup of aSPEM is linked to an explicit estimate of probabilities is unknown. Material and Method In order to answer these questions, we have set up an experi-ment comprising 3 blocks of 200 trials. For each trial, a tar-get makes either to the left or to the right, this direction being drawn from a Bernoulli process. The probability of this process varied in a piecewise-constant (that is, a step function varying be-tween 0 and 1), similarly to Meyniel et al. [2]. The occurence of these switches is itself drawn from a Bernoulli process of probability p switch = 1/40. We asked subjects to perform two tasks on different days :},

abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (“annealing”) or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel “relaxation” algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios. {\textcopyright} 1984, IEEE.},

abstract = {Abstract Multiple lines of evidence support the notion that the brain performs probabilistic inference in multiple cognitive domains, including perception and decision mak- ing. There is also evidence that probabilistic inference may be implemented in the brain through the (quasi-)stochastic activity of neural circuits, producing samples from the appropriate posterior distributions, effectively implementing a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. However, time becomes a fundamental bottleneck in such sampling-based probabilistic representations: the quality of inferences de- pends on how fast the neural circuit generates new, uncorrelated samples from its stationary distribution (the posterior). We explore this bottleneck in a sim- ple, linear-Gaussian latent variable model, in which posterior sampling can be achieved by stochastic neural networks with linear dynamics. The well-known Langevin sampling (LS) recipe, so far the only sampling algorithm for continu- ous variables of which a neural implementation has been suggested, naturally fits into this dynamical framework. However, we first show analytically and through simulations that the symmetry of the synaptic weight matrix implied by LS yields critically slow mixing when the posterior is high-dimensional. Next, using meth- ods from control theory, we construct and inspect networks that are optimally fast, and hence orders of magnitude faster than LS, while being far more biologically plausible. In these networks, strong – but transient – selective amplification of external noise generates the spatially correlated activity fluctuations prescribed by the posterior. Intriguingly, although a detailed balance of excitation and inhibition is dynamically maintained, detailed balance of Markov chain steps in the resulting sampler is violated, consistent with recent findings on how statistical irreversibil- ity can overcome the speed limitation of random walks in other domains.},

abstract = {This article introduces the finite state projection (FSP) method for use in the stochastic analysis of chemically reacting systems. One can describe the chemical populations of such systems with probability density vectors that evolve according to a set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the chemical master equation (CME). Unlike Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) or $\tau$ leaping, the FSP directly solves or approximates the solution of the CME. If the CME describes a system that has a finite number of distinct population vectors, the FSP method provides an exact analytical solution. When an infinite or extremely large number of population variations is possible, the state space can be truncated, and the FSP method provides a certificate of accuracy for how closely the truncated space approximation matches the true solution. The proposed FSP algorithm systematically increases the projection space in order to meet prespecified tolerance in the total probability density error. For any system in which a sufficiently accurate FSP exists, the FSP algorithm is shown to converge in a finite number of steps. The FSP is utilized to solve two examples taken from the field of systems biology, and comparisons are made between the FSP, the SSA, and $\tau$ leaping algorithms. In both examples, the FSP outperforms the SSA in terms of accuracy as well as computational efficiency. Furthermore, due to very small molecular counts in these particular examples, the FSP also performs far more effectively than $\tau$ leaping methods. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

However, the physiological mechanisms that underlie these changes are not fully understood. We review recent theoretical results that identify three separate mechanisms that modulate spike train correlations: changes in input correlations, internal fluctuations and the transfer function of single neurons. We first examine these mechanisms in feedforward pathways and then show how the same approach can explain the modulation of correlations in recurrent networks. Such mechanistic constraints on the modulation of population activity will be important in statistical analyses of high-dimensional neural data.},

abstract = {Cytokine activation of cells induces gene networks involved in inflammation and immunity. Transient gene activation can have a lasting effect even in the absence of ongoing transcription, known as long-term transcriptional memory. Here we explore the nature of the establishment and maintenance of interferon $\gamma$ (IFN$\gamma$)-induced priming of human cells. We find that, although ongoing transcription and local chromatin signatures are short-lived, the IFN$\gamma$-primed state stably propagates through at least 14 cell division cycles. Single-cell analysis reveals that memory is manifested by an increased probability of primed cells to engage in target gene expression, correlating with the strength of initial gene activation. Further, we find that strongly memorized genes tend to reside in genomic clusters and that long-term memory of these genes is locally restricted by cohesin. We define the duration, stochastic nature, and molecular mechanisms of IFN$\gamma$-induced transcriptional memory, relevant to understanding enhanced innate immune signaling.},

Characterization of transcriptional bursting, including the burst size and frequency, has mainly relied on live-cell4,6,8 or single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization3,5,8,9 recordings of selected loci. Here we determine transcriptome-wide burst frequencies and sizes for endogenous mouse and human genes using allele-sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing.

Notably, we provide transcriptome-wide evidence that enhancers control burst frequencies, and demonstrate that cell-type-specific gene expression is primarily shaped by changes in burst frequencies. Together, our data show that burst frequency is primarily encoded in enhancers and burst size in core promoters, and that allelic single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful model for investigating transcriptional kinetics.},

abstract = {Stochastic fluctuations of molecule numbers are ubiquitous in biological systems. Important examples include gene expression and enzymatic processes in living cells. Such systems are typically modelled as chemical reaction networks whose dynamics are governed by the chemical master equation. Despite its simple structure, no analytic solutions to the chemical master equation are known for most systems. Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive, making systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task. Consequently, significant effort has been spent in recent decades on the development of efficient approximation and inference methods. This article gives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of state of the art methods. First, we motivate and introduce deterministic and stochastic methods for modelling chemical networks, and give an overview of simulation and exact solution methods. Next, we discuss several approximation methods, including the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion, moment closure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid methods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and remaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of these methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight some of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of inference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent methods developed the literature. In summary, this review gives a self-contained introduction to modelling, approximations and inference methods for stochastic chemical kinetics.},

abstract = {How different is local cortical circuitry from a random network? To answer this question, we probed synaptic connections with several hundred simultaneous quadruple whole-cell recordings from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the rat visual cortex. Analysis of this dataset revealed several nonrandom features in synaptic connectivity. We confirmed previous reports that bidirectional connections are more common than expected in a random network. We found that several highly clustered three-neuron connectivity patterns are overrepresented, suggesting that connections tend to cluster together. We also analyzed synaptic connection strength as defined by the peak excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude. We found that the distribution of synaptic connection strength differs significantly from the Poisson distribution and can be fitted by a lognormal distribution. Such a distribution has a heavier tail and implies that synaptic weight is concentrated among few synaptic connections. In addition, the strengths of synaptic connections sharing pre- or postsynaptic neurons are correlated, implying that strong connections are even more clustered than the weak ones. Therefore, the local cortical network structure can be viewed as a skeleton of stronger connections in a sea of weaker ones. Such a skeleton is likely to play an important role in network dynamics and should be investigated further. {\textcopyright} 2005 Song et al.},

abstract = {Spike correlations between neurons are ubiquitous in the cortex, but their role is not understood. Here we describe the firing response of a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron (LIF) when it receives a temporarily correlated input generated by presynaptic correlated neuronal populations. Input correlations are characterized in terms of the firing rates, Fano factors, correlation coefficients, and correlation timescale of the neurons driving the target neuron. We show that the sum of the presynaptic spike trains cannot be well described by a Poisson process. In fact, the total input current has a nontrivial two-point correlation function described by two main parameters: the correlation timescale (how precise the input correlations are in time) and the correlation magnitude (how strong they are). Therefore, the total current generated by the input spike trains is not well described by a white noise gaussian process. Instead, we model the total current as a colored gaussian process with the same mean and two-point correlation function, leading to the formulation of the problem in terms of a Fokker-Planck equation. Solutions of the output firing rate are found in the limit of short and long correlation timescales. The solutions described here expand and improve on our previous results (Moreno, de la Rocha, Renart, {\&} Parga, 2002) by presenting new analytical expressions for the output firing rate for general IF neurons, extending the validity of the results for arbitrarily large correlation magnitude, and by describing the differential effect of correlations on the mean-driven or noise-dominated firing regimes. Also the details of this novel formalism are given here for the first time. We employ numerical simulations to confirm the analytical solutions and study the firing response to sudden changes in the input correlations. We expect this formalism to be useful for the study of correlations in neuronal networks and their role in neural processing and information transmission. {\textcopyright} 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {A novel formalism for Bayesian learning in the context of complex inference models is proposed. The method is based on the use of the stationary Fokker-Planck (SFP) approach to sample from the posterior density. Stationary Fokker-Planck sampling generalizes the Gibbs sampler algorithm for arbitrary and unknown conditional densities. By the SFP procedure, approximate analytical expressions for the conditionals and marginals of the posterior can be constructed. At each stage of SFP, the approximate conditionals are used to define a Gibbs sampling process, which is convergent to the full joint posterior. By the analytical marginals efficient learning methods in the context of artificial neural networks are outlined.Offline and incremental Bayesian inference andmaximum likelihood estimation from the posterior are performed in classification and regression examples.Acomparison of SFPwith otherMonte Carlo strategies in the general problem of sampling from arbitrary densities is also presented. It is shown that SFP is able to jump large low-probability regions without the need of a careful tuning of any step-size parameter. In fact, the SFP method requires only a small set of meaningful parameters that can be selected following clear, problem-independent guidelines. The computation cost of SFP, measured in terms of loss function evaluations, grows linearly with the given model's dimension. {\textcopyright} 2010 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

The mRNA profiles from IFN-$\alpha$, -$\beta$, or -$\gamma$ treatments of the human fibrosarcoma cell line, HT1080, were determined by using oligonucleotide arrays with probe sets corresponding to more than 6,800 human genes. Among these were transcripts for known IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), the expression of which were consistent with previous studies in which the particular ISG was characterized as responsive to either Type I ($\alpha$, $\beta$) or Type II ($\gamma$) IFNs, or both. Importantly, many novel IFN-stimulated genes were identified that were diverse in their known biological functions. For instance, several novel ISGs were identified that are implicated in apoptosis (including RAP46/Bag- 1, phospholipid scramblase, and hypoxia inducible factor-1$\alpha$). Furthermore, several IFN-repressed genes also were identified. These results demonstrate the usefulness of oligonucleotide arrays in monitoring mammalian gene expression on a broad and unprecedented scale. In particular, these findings provide insights into the basic mechanisms of IFN actions and ultimately may contribute to better therapeutic uses for IFNs.},

We study a recurrent network model in which both learning rules and distribution of stored patterns are inferred from distributions of visual responses for novel and familiar images in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Unlike classical attractor neural network models, our model exhibits graded activity in retrieval states, with distributions of firing rates that are close to lognormal. Inferred learning rules are close to maximizing the number of stored patterns within a family of unsupervised Hebbian learning rules, suggesting that learning rules in ITC are optimized to store a large number of attractor states. Finally, we show that there exist two types of retrieval states: one in which firing rates are constant in time and another in which firing rates fluctuate chaotically. A network model with a learning rule inferred from data recorded in the primate cortex exhibits attractor dynamics with nearly optimal storage capacity. A transition to chaotic dynamics is found at strong coupling, leading to highly irregular activity but stable memory.},

Specifically, rare subpopulations of cells occupy a transient pre-resistant state characterized by coordinated high expression of several genes and survive therapy. How might these rare states arise and disappear within the population? It is unclear whether the canonical models of probabilistic transcriptional pulsing can explain this behavior, or if it requires special, hitherto unidentified mechanisms. We show that a minimal model of transcriptional bursting and gene interactions can give rise to rare coordinated high expression states. These states occur more frequently in networks with low connectivity and depend on three parameters. While entry into these states is initiated by a long transcriptional burst that also triggers entry of other genes, the exit occurs through independent inactivation of individual genes. Together, we demonstrate that established principles of gene regulation are sufficient to describe this behavior and argue for its more general existence.

abstract = {The stochastic dynamical behavior of a well-stirred mixture of N molecular species that chemically interact through M reaction channels is accurately described by the chemical master equation. It is shown here that, whenever two explicit dynamical conditions are satisfied, the microphysical premise from which the chemical master equation is derived leads directly to an approximate time-evolution equation of the Langevin type. This chemical Langevin equation is the same as one studied earlier by Kurtz, in contradistinction to some other earlier proposed forms that assume a deterministic macroscopic evolution law. The novel aspect of the present analysis is that it shows that the accuracy of the equation depends on the satisfaction of certain specific conditions that can change from moment to moment, rather than on a static system size parameter. The derivation affords a new perspective on the origin and magnitude of noise in a chemically reacting system. It also clarifies the connection between the stochastically correct chemical master equation, and the deterministic but often satisfactory reaction rate equation. ͓S0021-9606͑00͒50925-8͔},

The reason for this discrepancy is not fully understood. One might argue that the randomness and complexity of biological systems are the main barriers to predictive understanding, but these issues are not unique to biology. Instead, we hypothesize that the specific shapes of rare single-molecule event distributions produce substantial yet overlooked challenges for biological models. We demonstrate why modern statistical tools to disentangle complexity and stochasticity, which assume normally distributed fluctuations or enormous datasets, do not apply to the discrete, positive, and nonsymmetric distributions that characterize mRNA fluctuations in single cells. As an example, we integrate single-molecule measurements and advanced computational analyses to explore mitogen-activated protein kinase induction of multiple stress response genes. Through systematic analyses of different metrics to compare the same model to the same data, we elucidate why standard modeling approaches yield nonpredictive models for single-cell gene regulation. We further explain how advanced tools recover precise, reproducible, and predictive understanding of transcription regulation mechanisms, including gene activation, polymerase initiation, elongation, mRNA accumulation, spatial transport, and decay.},

abstract = {PD-L1 expression and regulation by mesenchymal tumor cells remain largely undefined. Here, we report that among different EMT-activated MCF7 human breast cancer cell clones, PD-L1 was differentially upregulated in MCF7 sh-WISP2, MCF7–1001/2101, and MDA-MB-231 cells but not in MCF7 SNAI1 and MCF7 SNAI1–6SA cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that siRNA silencing of ZEB-1, but not SNAI1, TWIST, or SLUG and overexpression of miR200 family members in MCF7 sh-WISP2 cells strongly decreased PD-L1 expression. Thus, we propose that PD-L1 expression in EMT-activated breast cancer cells depends on the EMT-TF involved in EMT activation. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated targeting of PD-L1 or antibodymediated PD-L1 block restored the susceptibility of highly resistant MCF7 sh-WISP2 and MCF7–2101 cells to CTL-mediated killing. Additionally, these results provide a novel preclinical rationale to explore EMT inhibitors as adjuvants to boost immunotherapeutic responses in subgroups of patients in whom malignant progression is driven by different EMT-TFs.},

abstract = {A correlation-based (“Hebbian”) learning rule at a spike level with millisecond resolution is formulated, mathematically analyzed, and compared with learning in a firing-rate description. The relative timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes influences synaptic weights via an asymmetric “learning window.” A differential equation for the learning dynamics is derived under the assumption that the time scales of learning and neuronal spike dynamics can be separated. The differential equation is solved for a Poissonian neuron model with stochastic spike arrival. It is shown that correlations between input and output spikes tend to stabilize structure formation. With an appropriate choice of parameters, learning leads to an intrinsic normalization of the average weight and the output firing rate. Noise generates diffusion-like spreading of synaptic weights. {\textcopyright} 1999 The American Physical Society.},

Instead of using random graph models, which are known to only partly capture the structural properties of biological networks, we generate network structures by extracting modules from known biological interaction networks. Using the yeast transcriptional regulatory network as a test case, we show that extracted modules have a biologically plausible connectivity because they preserve functional and structural properties of the original network.

Binding of PD-L1 to its receptor PD-1 on activated T cells inhibits anti-tumor immunity by counteracting T cell-activating signals. Antibody-based PD-1-PD-L1 inhibitors can induce durable tumor remissions in patients with diverse advanced cancers, and thus expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and other cells in the tumor microenviroment is of major clinical relevance. Here we review the roles of the PD-1-PD-L1 axis in cancer, focusing on recent findings on the mechanisms that regulate PD-L1 expression at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and protein level. We place this knowledge in the context of observations in the clinic and discuss how it may inform the design of more precise and effective cancer immune checkpoint therapies.

There are four learning algorithms for GPDMs: maximizing a posterior (MAP), fixing the kernel hyperparameters $\alpha$¯ (Fix.$\alpha$¯), balanced GPDM (B-GPDM) and two-stage MAP (T.MAP), which are designed for model training with complete data. When data are incomplete, GPDMs reconstruct the missing data using a function of the latent variables before parameter updates, which, however, may cause cumulative errors. In this paper, we present four new algorithms (MAP+, Fix.$\alpha$¯+, B-GPDM+ and T.MAP+) for learning GPDMs with incomplete training data and a new conditional model (CM+) for recovering incomplete test data. Our methods adopt the Bayesian framework and can fully and properly use the partially observed data. We conduct experiments on incomplete motion capture data (walk, run, swing and multiple-walker) and make comparisons with the existing four algorithms as well as k-NN, spline interpolation and VGPDS. Our methods perform much better on both training with incomplete data and recovering incomplete test data.},

abstract = {Recent psychophysical experiments indicate that humans perform near-optimal Bayesian inference in a wide variety of tasks, ranging from cue integration to decision making to motor control. This implies that neurons both represent probability distributions and combine those distributions according to a close approximation to Bayes' rule. At first sight, it would seem that the high variability in the responses of cortical neurons would make it difficult to implement such optimal statistical inference in cortical circuits. We argue that, in fact, this variability implies that populations of neurons automatically represent probability distributions over the stimulus, a type of code we call probabilistic population codes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Poisson-like variability observed in cortex reduces a broad class of Bayesian inference to simple linear combinations of populations of neural activity. These results hold for arbitrary probability distributions over the stimulus, for tuning curves of arbitrary shape and for realistic neuronal variability. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The dynamics of local cortical networks are irregular, but correlated. Dynamic excitatory–inhibitory balance is a plausible mechanism that generates such irregular activity, but it remains unclear how balance is achieved and maintained in plastic neural networks. In particular, it is not fully understood how plasticity induced changes in the network affect balance, and in turn, how correlated, balanced activity impacts learning. How do the dynamics of balanced networks change under different plasticity rules? How does correlated spiking activity in recurrent networks change the evolution of weights, their eventual magnitude, and structure across the network? To address these questions, we develop a theory of spike–timing dependent plasticity in balanced networks. We show that balance can be attained and maintained under plasticity–induced weight changes. We find that correlations in the input mildly affect the evolution of synaptic weights. Under certain plasticity rules, we find an emergence of correlations between firing rates and synaptic weights. Under these rules, synaptic weights converge to a stable manifold in weight space with their final configuration dependent on the initial state of the network. Lastly, we show that our framework can also describe the dynamics of plastic balanced networks when subsets of neurons receive targeted optogenetic input.},

abstract = {Cells receive a wide variety of cellular and environmental signals, which are often processed combinatorially to generate specific genetic responses. Here we explore theoretically the potentials and limitations of combinatorial signal integration at the level of cis-regulatory transcription control. Our analysis suggests that many complex transcription-control functions of the type encountered in higher eukaryotes are already implementable within the much simpler bacterial transcription system. Using a quantitative model of bacterial transcription and invoking only specific protein-DNA interaction and weak glue-like interaction between regulatory proteins, we show explicit schemes to implement regulatory logic functions of increasing complexity by appropriately selecting the strengths and arranging the relative positions of the relevant protein-binding DNA sequences in the cis-regulatory region. The architectures that emerge are naturally modular and evolvable. Our results suggest that the transcription regulatory apparatus is a "programmable" computing machine, belonging formally to the class of Boltzmann machines. Crucial to our results is the ability to regulate gene expression at a distance. In bacteria, this can be achieved for isolated genes via DNA looping controlled by the dimerization of DNA-bound proteins. However, if adopted extensively in the genome, long-distance interaction can cause unintentional intergenic cross talk, a detrimental side effect difficult to overcome by the known bacterial transcription-regulation systems. This may be a key factor limiting the genome-wide adoption of complex transcription control in bacteria. Implications of our findings for combinatorial transcription control in eukaryotes are discussed.},

abstract = {Correlations in spike-train ensembles can seriously impair the encoding of information by their spatio-temporal structure. An inevitable source of correlation in finite neural networks is common presynaptic input to pairs of neurons. Recent studies demonstrate that spike correlations in recurrent neural networks are considerably smaller than expected based on the amount of shared presynaptic input. Here, we explain this observation by means of a linear network model and simulations of networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We show that inhibitory feedback efficiently suppresses pairwise correlations and, hence, population-rate fluctuations, thereby assigning inhibitory neurons the new role of active decorrelation. We quantify this decorrelation by comparing the responses of the intact recurrent network (feedback system) and systems where the statistics of the feedback channel is perturbed (feedforward system). Manipulations of the feedback statistics can lead to a significant increase in the power and coherence of the population response. In particular, neglecting correlations within the ensemble of feedback channels or between the external stimulus and the feedback amplifies population-rate fluctuations by orders of magnitude. The fluctuation suppression in homogeneous inhibitory networks is explained by a negative feedback loop in the one-dimensional dynamics of the compound activity. Similarly, a change of coordinates exposes an effective negative feedback loop in the compound dynamics of stable excitatory-inhibitory networks. The suppression of input correlations in finite networks is explained by the population averaged correlations in the linear network model: In purely inhibitory networks, shared-input correlations are canceled by negative spike-train correlations. In excitatory-inhibitory networks, spike-train correlations are typically positive. Here, the suppression of input correlations is not a result of the mere existence of correlations between excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons, but a consequence of a particular structure of correlations among the three possible pairings (EE, EI, II). {\textcopyright} 2012 Tetzlaff et al.},

Among many other network approaches, probabilistic graphical models provide a comprehensive probabilistic characterization of interaction patterns between molecules and the associated uncertainties. Results: In this article, we first review graphical models, including directed, undirected, and reciprocal graphs (RG), with an emphasis on the RG models that are curiously under-utilized in biostatistics and bioinformatics literature. RG's strictly contain chain graphs as a special case and are suitable to model reciprocal causality such as feedback mechanism in molecular networks. We then extend the RG approach to modeling molecular networks by integrating DNA-, RNA- and protein-level data. We apply the extended RG method to The Cancer Genome Atlas multi-platform ovarian cancer data and reveal several interesting findings. Conclusions: This study aims to review the basics of different probabilistic graphical models as well as recent development in RG approaches for network modeling. The extension presented in this paper provides a principled and efficient way of integrating DNA copy number, DNA methylation, mRNA gene expression and protein expression.},

This paper develops a method called BINGO to specifically deal with these issues. Benchmarked with both real and simulated time-series data covering many different gene regulatory networks, BINGO clearly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The novelty of BINGO lies in a nonparametric approach featuring statistical sampling of continuous gene expression profiles. BINGO's superior performance and ease of use, even by non-specialists, make gene regulatory network inference available to any researcher, helping to decipher the complex mechanisms of life.},

Most research in GPSSMs has focussed on the state estimation problem, i.e., computing a posterior of the latent state given the model. However, the key challenge in GPSSMs has not been satisfactorily addressed yet: system identification, i.e., learning the model. To address this challenge, we impose a structured Gaussian variational posterior distribution over the latent states, which is parameterised by a recognition model in the form of a bi-directional recurrent neural network. Inference with this structure allows us to recover a posterior smoothed over sequences of data. We provide a practical algorithm for efficiently computing a lower bound on the marginal likelihood using the reparameterisation trick. This further allows for the use of arbitrary kernels within the GPSSM. We demonstrate that the learnt GPSSM can efficiently generate plausible future trajectories of the identified system after only observing a small number of episodes from the true system.},

abstract = {Novel experimental techniques reveal the simultaneous activity of larger and larger numbers of neurons. As a result there is increasing interest in the structure of cooperative - or correlated - activity in neural populations, and in the possible impact of such correlations on the neural code. A fundamental theoretical challenge is to understand how the architecture of network connectivity along with the dynamical properties of single cells shape the magnitude and timescale of correlations. We provide a general approach to this problem by extending prior techniques based on linear response theory. We consider networks of general integrate-and-fire cells with arbitrary architecture, and provide explicit expressions for the approximate cross-correlation between constituent cells. These correlations depend strongly on the operating point (input mean and variance) of the neurons, even when connectivity is fixed. Moreover, the approximations admit an expansion in powers of the matrices that describe the network architecture. This expansion can be readily interpreted in terms of paths between different cells. We apply our results to large excitatory-inhibitory networks, and demonstrate first how precise balance - or lack thereof - between the strengths and timescales of excitatory and inhibitory synapses is reflected in the overall correlation structure of the network. We then derive explicit expressions for the average correlation structure in randomly connected networks. These expressions help to identify the important factors that shape coordinated neural activity in such networks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Trousdale et al.},

abstract = {Background: Antibodies targeting PD-1 and its ligand PDL1 are used in cancer immunotherapy but may lead to autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D). It remains unclear whether PDL1 is expressed in pancreatic islets of people with T1D and how is it regulated. Methods: The expression of PDL1, IRF1, insulin and glucagon was evaluated in samples of T1D donors by immunofluorescence. Cytokine-induced PDL1 expression in the human beta cell line, EndoC-$\beta$H1, and in primary human pancreatic islets was determined by real-time RT-PCR, flow cytometry and Western blot. Specific and previously validated small interference RNAs were used to inhibit STAT1, STAT2, IRF1 and JAK1 signaling. Key results were validated using the JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib. Findings: PDL1 was present in insulin-positive cells from twelve T1D individuals (6 living and 6 deceased donors) but absent from insulin-deficient islets or from the islets of six non-diabetic controls. Interferons-$\alpha$ and -$\gamma$, but not interleukin-1$\beta$, induced PDL1 expression in vitro in human islet cells and EndoC-$\beta$H1 cells. Silencing of STAT1 or STAT2 individually did not prevent interferon-$\alpha$-induced PDL1, while blocking of JAKs – a proposed therapeutic strategy for T1D – or IRF1 prevented PDL1 induction. Interpretation: These findings indicate that PDL1 is expressed in beta cells from people with T1D, possibly to attenuate the autoimmune assault, and that it is induced by both type I and II interferons via IRF1.},

abstract = {Transcription is an episodic process characterized by probabilistic bursts, but how the transcriptional noise from these bursts is modulated by cellular physiology remains unclear. Using simulations and single-molecule RNA counting, we examined how cellular processes influence cell-to-cell variability (noise). The results show that RNA noise is higher in the cytoplasm than the nucleus in ∼85{\%} of genes across diverse promoters, genomic loci, and cell types (human and mouse). Measurements show further amplification of RNA noise in the cytoplasm, fitting a model of biphasic mRNA conversion between translation- and degradation-competent states. This multi-state translation-degradation of mRNA also causes substantial noise amplification in protein levels, ultimately accounting for ∼74{\%} of intrinsic protein variability in cell populations. Overall, the results demonstrate how noise from transcriptional bursts is intrinsically amplified by mRNA processing, leading to a large super-Poissonian variability in protein levels. Transcription is a noisy process characterized by probabilistic bursts, but how fluctuations (noise) propagate from transcription through translation in eukaryotic cells remains unclear. Hansen et al. discover that the processes of mRNA export, translation, and degradation, in general, amplify transcriptional noise, generating large variability in cell-to-cell protein levels.},

abstract = {Single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) provides unparalleled resolution in the measurement of the abundance and localization of nascent and mature RNA transcripts in fixed, single cells. We developed a computational pipeline (BayFish) to infer the kinetic parameters of gene expression from smFISH data at multiple time points after gene induction. Given an underlying model of gene expression, BayFish uses a Monte Carlo method to estimate the Bayesian posterior probability of the model parameters and quantify the parameter uncertainty given the observed smFISH data. We tested BayFish on synthetic data and smFISH measurements of the neuronal activity-inducible gene Npas4 in primary neurons.},

@article{Larsson2019a,
abstract = {Mammalian gene expression is inherently stochastic1,2, and results in discrete bursts of RNA molecules that are synthesized from each allele3–7. Although transcription is known to be regulated by promoters and enhancers, it is unclear how cis-regulatory sequences encode transcriptional burst kinetics. Characterization of transcriptional bursting, including the burst size and frequency, has mainly relied on live-cell4,6,8 or single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization3,5,8,9 recordings of selected loci. Here we determine transcriptome-wide burst frequencies and sizes for endogenous mouse and human genes using allele-sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing. We show that core promoter elements affect burst size and uncover synergistic effects between TATA and initiator elements, which were masked at mean expression levels. Notably, we provide transcriptome-wide evidence that enhancers control burst frequencies, and demonstrate that cell-type-specific gene expression is primarily shaped by changes in burst frequencies. Together, our data show that burst frequency is primarily encoded in enhancers and burst size in core promoters, and that allelic single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful model for investigating transcriptional kinetics.},

@article{Williams2010,
abstract = {Of the various attempts to generalize information theory to multiple variables, the most widely utilized, interaction information, suffers from the problem that it is sometimes negative. Here we reconsider from first principles the general structure of the information that a set of sources provides about a given variable. We begin with a new definition of redundancy as the minimum information that any source provides about each possible outcome of the variable, averaged over all possible outcomes. We then show how this measure of redundancy induces a lattice over sets of sources that clarifies the general structure of multivariate information. Finally, we use this redundancy lattice to propose a definition of partial information atoms that exhaustively decompose the Shannon information in a multivariate system in terms of the redundancy between synergies of subsets of the sources. Unlike interaction information, the atoms of our partial information decomposition are never negative and always support a clear interpretation as informational quantities. Our analysis also demonstrates how the negativity of interaction information can be explained by its confounding of redundancy and synergy.},
