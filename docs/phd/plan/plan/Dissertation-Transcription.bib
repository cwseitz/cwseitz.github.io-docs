abstract = {IFN-induction of the CIITA (class II transactivator) promoter (pIV) requires Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), a chromatin-remodeling enzyme. However, the events that lead to pIV activation are only partially understood, and the point at which BRG1 acts is unknown. The first IFN-induced event triggers nuclear translocation of STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1), which binds IFN-responsive promoters. BRG1 is recruited after activator binding at several other inducible loci, and STAT family members are known to bind BRG1, suggesting that BRG1 might act downstream of STAT1. Here, we delineate a comprehensive view of factor assembly and detailed histone modifications at pIV and show that all events, even STAT1 binding, require BRG1 at CIITA pIV and other IFN-target promoters. Recruitment of IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3) [STAT1STAT2IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9)] to several IFN-responsive promoters is also BRG1-dependent. In contrast, constitutive BRG1 association at IFN targets is STAT1-independent. Furthermore, BRG1 is required for IFN-induced restriction enzyme and DNase I accessibility at promoters. Thus, BRG1 has an apical role in cytokine-induced promoter assembly, acting upstream of STAT complexes at multiple IFN target loci. BRG1-associated factor chromatin interferon SWISNF},

abstract = {While single-cell gene expression experiments present new challenges for data processing, the cell-to-cell variability observed also reveals statistical relationships that can be used by information theory. Here, we use multivariate information theory to explore the statistical dependencies between triplets of genes in single-cell gene expression datasets. We develop PIDC, a fast, efficient algorithm that uses partial information decomposition (PID) to identify regulatory relationships between genes. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate that the higher-order information captured by PIDC allows it to outperform pairwise mutual information-based algorithms when recovering true relationships present in simulated data. We also infer gene regulatory networks from three experimental single-cell datasets and illustrate how network context, choices made during analysis, and sources of variability affect network inference. PIDC tutorials and open-source software for estimating PID are available. PIDC should facilitate the identification of putative functional relationships and mechanistic hypotheses from single-cell transcriptomic data. Chan et al. develop PIDC, a fast, efficient algorithm that makes use of multivariate information theory, to reliably infer gene-gene interactions in heterogeneous, single-cell gene expression data and build gene regulatory networks.},

abstract = {Transcription occurs in stochastic bursts. Early models based upon RNA hybridisation studies suggest bursting dynamics arise from alternating inactive and permissive states. Here we investigate bursting mechanism in live cells by quantitative imaging of actin gene transcription, combined with molecular genetics, stochastic simulation and probabilistic modelling. In contrast to early models, our data indicate a continuum of transcriptional states, with a slowly fluctuating initiation rate converting the gene between different levels of activity, interspersed with extended periods of inactivity. We place an upper limit of 40 s on the lifetime of fluctuations in elongation rate, with initiation rate variations persisting an order of magnitude longer. TATA mutations reduce the accessibility of high activity states, leaving the lifetime of on- and off-states unchanged. A continuum or spectrum of gene states potentially enables a wide dynamic range for cell responses to stimuli.},

abstract = {The carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) is phosphorylated during transcription in eukaryotic cells. While residue-specific phosphorylation has been mapped with exquisite spatial resolution along the 1D genome in a population of fixed cells using immunoprecipitation-based assays, the timing, kinetics, and spatial organization of phosphorylation along a single-copy gene have not yet been measured in living cells. Here, we achieve this by combining multi-color, single-molecule microscopy with fluorescent antibody-based probes that specifically bind to different phosphorylated forms of endogenous RNAP2 in living cells. Applying this methodology to a single-copy HIV-1 reporter gene provides live-cell evidence for heterogeneity in the distribution of RNAP2 along the length of the gene as well as Serine 5 phosphorylated RNAP2 clusters that remain separated in both space and time from nascent mRNA synthesis. Computational models determine that 5 to 40 RNAP2 cluster around the promoter during a typical transcriptional burst, with most phosphorylated at Serine 5 within 6 seconds of arrival and roughly half escaping the promoter in {\~{}}1.5 minutes. Taken together, our data provide live-cell support for the notion of efficient transcription clusters that transiently form around promoters and contain high concentrations of RNAP2 phosphorylated at Serine 5.},

abstract = {Despite substantial experimental and computational efforts, mechanistic modeling remains more predictive in engineering than in systems biology. The reason for this discrepancy is not fully understood. One might argue that the randomness and complexity of biological systems are the main barriers to predictive understanding, but these issues are not unique to biology. Instead, we hypothesize that the specific shapes of rare single-molecule event distributions produce substantial yet overlooked challenges for biological models. We demonstrate why modern statistical tools to disentangle complexity and stochasticity, which assume normally distributed fluctuations or enormous datasets, do not apply to the discrete, positive, and nonsymmetric distributions that characterize mRNA fluctuations in single cells. As an example, we integrate single-molecule measurements and advanced computational analyses to explore mitogen-activated protein kinase induction of multiple stress response genes. Through systematic analyses of different metrics to compare the same model to the same data, we elucidate why standard modeling approaches yield nonpredictive models for single-cell gene regulation. We further explain how advanced tools recover precise, reproducible, and predictive understanding of transcription regulation mechanisms, including gene activation, polymerase initiation, elongation, mRNA accumulation, spatial transport, and decay.},

abstract = {Gene expression is controlled by transcription factors (TFs) that consist of DNA-binding domains (DBDs) and activation domains (ADs). The DBDs have been well characterized, but little is known about the mechanisms by which ADs effect gene activation. Here, we report that diverse ADs form phase-separated condensates with the Mediator coactivator. For the OCT4 and GCN4 TFs, we show that the ability to form phase-separated droplets with Mediator in vitro and the ability to activate genes in vivo are dependent on the same amino acid residues. For the estrogen receptor (ER), a ligand-dependent activator, we show that estrogen enhances phase separation with Mediator, again linking phase separation with gene activation. These results suggest that diverse TFs can interact with Mediator through the phase-separating capacity of their ADs and that formation of condensates with Mediator is involved in gene activation.},

abstract = {This article introduces the finite state projection (FSP) method for use in the stochastic analysis of chemically reacting systems. One can describe the chemical populations of such systems with probability density vectors that evolve according to a set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the chemical master equation (CME). Unlike Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) or $\tau$ leaping, the FSP directly solves or approximates the solution of the CME. If the CME describes a system that has a finite number of distinct population vectors, the FSP method provides an exact analytical solution. When an infinite or extremely large number of population variations is possible, the state space can be truncated, and the FSP method provides a certificate of accuracy for how closely the truncated space approximation matches the true solution. The proposed FSP algorithm systematically increases the projection space in order to meet prespecified tolerance in the total probability density error. For any system in which a sufficiently accurate FSP exists, the FSP algorithm is shown to converge in a finite number of steps. The FSP is utilized to solve two examples taken from the field of systems biology, and comparisons are made between the FSP, the SSA, and $\tau$ leaping algorithms. In both examples, the FSP outperforms the SSA in terms of accuracy as well as computational efficiency. Furthermore, due to very small molecular counts in these particular examples, the FSP also performs far more effectively than $\tau$ leaping methods. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In recent years, it has been experimentally established that transcription, a fundamental biological process that involves the synthesis of messenger RNA molecules from DNA templates, does not proceed continuously as was expected. Rather, it exhibits a distinct dynamic behavior of alternating between productive phases when RNA molecules are actively synthesized and inactive phases when there is no RNA production at all. The bimodal transcriptional dynamics is now confirmed to be present in most living systems. This phenomenon is known as transcriptional bursting and it attracts significant amounts of attention from researchers in different fields. However, despite multiple experimental and theoretical investigations, the microscopic origin and biological functions of the transcriptional bursting remain unclear. Here we discuss the recent developments in uncovering the underlying molecular mechanisms of transcriptional bursting and our current understanding of them. Our analysis presents a physicochemical view of the processes that govern transcriptional bursting in living cells.},

abstract = {Epigenetic memory for signal-dependent transcription has remained elusive. So far, the concept of epigenetic memory has been largely limited to cell-autonomous, preprogrammed processes such as development and metabolism. Here we show that IFN$\beta$ stimulation creates transcriptional memory in fibroblasts, conferring faster and greater transcription upon restimulation. The memory was inherited through multiple cell divisions and led to improved antiviral protection. Of {\~{}}2,000 IFN$\beta$-stimulated genes (ISGs), about half exhibited memory, which we define as memory ISGs. The rest, designated nonmemory ISGs, did not show memory. Surprisingly, mechanistic analysis showed that IFN memory was not due to enhanced IFN signaling or retention of transcription factors on the ISGs. We demonstrated that this memory was attributed to accelerated recruitment of RNA polymerase II and transcription/chromatin factors, which coincided with acquisition of the histone H3.3 and H3K36me3 chromatin marks on memory ISGs. Similar memory was observed in bone marrow macrophages after IFN$\gamma$ stimulation, suggesting that IFN stimulation modifies the shape of the innate immune response. Together, external signals can establish epigenetic memory in mammalian cells that imparts lasting adaptive performance upon various somatic cells.},

abstract = {As an effective and versatile strategy to compartmentalize cellular components without the need for lipid membranes, phase separation has been found to underpin a wide range of intranuclear processes, particularly those involving chromatin. Many of the unique physico-chemical properties of chromatin-based phase condensates are harnessed by the cell to accomplish complex regulatory functions in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. Here, we survey key recent findings on the mechanistic roles of phase separation in regulating the organization and dynamics of chromatin-based molecular processes across length scales, packing states and intranuclear functions, with a particular emphasis on quantitative characterizations of these condensates enabled by advanced imaging-based approaches. By illuminating the complex interplay between chromatin and various chromatin-interacting molecular species mediated by phase separation, this review sheds light on an emerging multi-scale, multi-modal and multi-faceted landscape that hierarchically regulates the genome within the highly crowded and dynamic nuclear space. Moreover, deficiencies in existing studies also highlight the need for mechanism-specific criteria and multi-parametric approaches for the characterization of chromatin-based phase separation using complementary techniques and call for greater efforts to correlate the quantitative features of these condensates with their functional consequences in close-to-native cellular contexts.},

abstract = {Motivation: Quantitative estimation of the regulatory relationship between transcription factors and genes is a fundamental stepping stone when trying to develop models of cellular processes. Recent experimental high-throughput techniques, such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) provide important information about the architecture of the regulatory networks in the cell. However, it is very difficult to measure the concentration levels of transcription factor proteins and determine their regulatory effect on gene transcription. It is therefore an important computational challenge to infer these quantities using gene expression data and network architecture data. Results: We develop a probabilistic state space model that allows genome-wide inference of both transcription factor protein concentrations and their effect on the transcription rates of each target gene from microarray data. We use variational inference techniques to learn the model parameters and perform posterior inference of protein concentrations and regulatory strengths. The probabilistic nature of the model also means that we can associate credibility intervals to our estimates, as well as providing a tool to detect which binding events lead to significant regulation. We demonstrate our model on artificial data and on two yeast datasets in which the network structure has previously been obtained using ChIP data. Predictions from our model are consistent with the underlying biology and offer novel quantitative insights into the regulatory structure of the yeast cell. {\textcopyright} 2006 Oxford University Press.},

Transient gene activation can have a lasting effect even in the absence of ongoing transcription, known as long-term transcriptional memory.

We find that, although ongoing transcription and local chromatin signatures are short-lived, the IFN$\gamma$-primed state stably propagates through at least 14 cell division cycles. Single-cell analysis reveals that memory is manifested by an increased probability of primed cells to engage in target gene expression, correlating with the strength of initial gene activation. Further, we find that strongly memorized genes tend to reside in genomic clusters and that long-term memory of these genes is locally restricted by cohesin. We define the duration, stochastic nature, and molecular mechanisms of IFN$\gamma$-induced transcriptional memory, relevant to understanding enhanced innate immune signaling.},

abstract = {Stochastic fluctuations of molecule numbers are ubiquitous in biological systems. Important examples include gene expression and enzymatic processes in living cells. Such systems are typically modelled as chemical reaction networks whose dynamics are governed by the chemical master equation. Despite its simple structure, no analytic solutions to the chemical master equation are known for most systems. Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive, making systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task. Consequently, significant effort has been spent in recent decades on the development of efficient approximation and inference methods. This article gives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of state of the art methods. First, we motivate and introduce deterministic and stochastic methods for modelling chemical networks, and give an overview of simulation and exact solution methods. Next, we discuss several approximation methods, including the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion, moment closure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid methods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and remaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of these methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight some of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of inference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent methods developed the literature.

abstract = {Stochasticity is a key characteristic of intracellular processes such as gene regulation and chemical signalling. Therefore, characterizing stochastic effects in biochemical systems is essential to understand the complex dynamics of living things. Mathematical idealizations of biochemically reacting systems must be able to capture stochastic phenomena. While robust theory exists to describe such stochastic models, the computational challenges in exploring these models can be a significant burden in practice since realistic models are analytically intractable. Determining the expected behaviour and variability of a stochastic biochemical reaction network requires many probabilistic simulations of its evolution. Using a biochemical reaction network model to assist in the interpretation of time-course data from a biological experiment is an even greater challenge due to the intractability of the likelihood function for determining observation probabilities. These computational challenges have been subjects of active research for over four decades. In this review, we present an accessible discussion of the major historical developments and state-of-the-art computational techniques relevant to simulation and inference problems for stochastic biochemical reaction network models. Detailed algorithms for particularly important methods are described and complemented with Matlabw implementations. As a result, this review provides a practical and accessible introduction to computational methods for stochastic models within the life sciences community.},

abstract = {Gene expression is an inherently stochastic process: Genes are activated and inactivated by random association and dissociation events, transcription is typically rare, and many proteins are present in low numbers per cell. The last few years have seen an explosion in the stochastic modeling of these processes, predicting protein fluctuations in terms of the frequencies of the probabilistic events. Here I discuss commonalities between theoretical descriptions, focusing on a gene-mRNA-protein model that includes most published studies as special cases. I also show how expression bursts can be explained as simplistic time-averaging, and how generic approximations can allow for concrete interpretations without requiring concrete assumptions. Measures and nomenclature are discussed to some extent and the modeling literature is briefly reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@techreport{Gillepsie1976,
abstract = {An exact method is presented for numerically calculating, within the framework of the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, the time evolution of any spatially homogeneous mixture of molecular species which interreact through a specified set of coupled chemical reaction channels. The method is a compact, computer-oriented, Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It should be particularly useful for modehng the transient behavior of well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular species participate in many highly coupled chemical reactions. For "ordinary" chemical systems in which fluctuations and correlations play no significant role, the method stands as an alternative to the traditional procedure of numerically solving the deterministic reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near chemical instabilities, where fluctuations and correlations may invalidate the deterministic equations, the method constitutes an efficient way of numerically examining the predictions of the stochastic master equation. Although fully equivalent to the spatially homogeneous master equation, the numerical simulation algorithm presented here is more directly based on a newly defined entity called "the reaction probability density function." The purpose of this article is to describe the mechanics of the simulation algorithm, and to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner its physical and mathematical validity; numerical applications to specific chemical systems will be presented in subsequent publications.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic transcription occurs in bursts that vary in size and frequency, but the contribution of individual core promoter elements to transcriptional bursting is not known. Here we analyze the relative contributions to bursting of the individual core promoter elements- CCAAT, TATAA-like, Sp1BS, and Inr-of an MHC class I gene in primary B-cells during both basal and activated transcription. The TATAA-like, Sp1BS, and Inr elements all function as negative regulators of transcription, and each was found to contribute differentially to the overall bursting pattern of the promoter during basal transcription. Whereas the Sp1BS element regulates burst size, the Inr element regulates burst frequency. The TATAA-like element contributes to both. Surprisingly, each element has a distinct role in bursting during transcriptional activation by $\gamma$-interferon. The CCAAT element does not contribute significantly to the constitutive transcriptional dynamics of primary B-cells, but modulates both burst size and frequency in response to $\gamma$-interferon activation. The ability of core promoter elements to modulate transcriptional bursting individually allows combinatorial fine-Tuning of the level of MHC class I gene expression in response to intrinsic and extrinsic signals.},

@article{Yan2017a,
abstract = {Problematic Humans are able to accurately track a moving object with a combi-nation of saccades and smooth eye movements. These movements allow us to align and stabilize the object on the fovea, thus en-abling high-resolution visual detection. When predictive informa-tion is available about target motion, anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements (aSPEM) are efficiently generated before target appearance, which reduce the typical sensorimotor delay between target motion onset and foveation. It is generally assumed that the role of anticipatory eye movements is to limit the behavioral impairment due to eye-to-target position and velocity mismatch. By manipulating the probability for target motion direction we were able to bias the direction and mean velocity of aSPEM, as mea-sured during a fixed duration gap before target ramp-motion onset. This suggests that probabilistic information may be used to inform the internal representation of motion prediction for the initiation of anticipatory movements [1]. However, such estimate may become particularly challenging in a dynamic context, where the probabilistic contingencies vary in time in an unpredictable way. In addition, whether and how the infor-mation processing underlying the buildup of aSPEM is linked to an explicit estimate of probabilities is unknown. Material and Method In order to answer these questions, we have set up an experi-ment comprising 3 blocks of 200 trials. For each trial, a tar-get makes either to the left or to the right, this direction being drawn from a Bernoulli process. The probability of this process varied in a piecewise-constant (that is, a step function varying be-tween 0 and 1), similarly to Meyniel et al. [2]. The occurence of these switches is itself drawn from a Bernoulli process of probability p switch = 1/40. We asked subjects to perform two tasks on different days :},

abstract = {In individual cells, transcription is a random process obeying single-molecule kinetics. Often, it occurs in a bursty, intermittent manner. The frequency and size of these bursts affect the magnitude of temporal fluctuations in messenger RNA and protein content within a cell, creating variation or "noise" in gene expression. It is still unclear to what degree transcriptional kinetics are specific to each gene and determined by its promoter sequence. Alternative scenarios have been proposed, in which the kinetics of transcription are governed by cellular constraints and follow universal rules across the genome. Evidence from genome-wide noise studies and from systematic perturbations of promoter sequences suggest that both scenarios - namely gene-specific versus genome-wide regulation of transcription kinetics - may be present to different degrees in bacteria, yeast, and animal cells.},

@article{Catanach2020b,
abstract = {Stochastic reaction network models are often used to explain and predict the dynamics of gene regulation in single cells. These models usually involve several parameters, such as the kinetic rates of chemical reactions, that are not directly measurable and must be inferred from experimental data. Bayesian inference provides a rigorous probabilistic framework for identifying these parameters by finding a posterior parameter distribution that captures their uncer-tainty. Traditional computational methods for solving inference problems such as Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on the classical Metropolis-Hastings algorithm involve numerous serial evaluations of the likelihood function, which in turn requires expensive forward solutions of the chemical master equation (CME). We propose an alternate approach based on a multifidelity extension of the sequential tempered Markov chain Monte Carlo (ST-MCMC) sam-pler. This algorithm is built upon sequential Monte Carlo and solves the Bayesian inference problem by decomposing it into a sequence of efficiently solved subproblems that gradually increase both model fidelity and the influence of the observed data. We reformulate the finite state projection (FSP) algorithm, a well-known method for solving the CME, to produce a hierarchy of surrogate master equations to be used in this multifidelity scheme. To determine the appro-priate fidelity, we introduce a novel information-theoretic criterion that seeks to extract the most information about the ultimate Bayesian posterior from each model in the hierarchy without inducing significant bias. This novel sampling scheme is tested with high-performance computing resources using biologically relevant problems.},

abstract = {Gene expression dynamics, such as stochastic oscillations and aperiodic fluctuations, have been associated with cell fate changes in multiple contexts, including development and cancer. Single cell live imaging of protein expression with endogenous reporters is widely used to observe such gene expression dynamics. However, the experimental investigation of regulatory mechanisms underlying the observed dynamics is challenging, since these mechanisms include complex interactions of multiple processes, including transcription, translation and protein degradation. Here, we present a Bayesian method to infer kinetic parameters of oscillatory gene expression regulation using an auto-negative feedback motif with delay. Specifically, we use a delay-adapted nonlinear Kalman filter within a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm to identify posterior probability distributions. Our method can be applied to time-series data on gene expression from single cells and is able to infer multiple parameters simultaneously. We apply it to published data on murine neural progenitor cells and show that it outperforms alternative methods. We further analyse how parameter uncertainty depends on the duration and time resolution of an imaging experiment, to make experimental design recommendations. This work demonstrates the utility of parameter inference on time course data from single cells and enables new studies on cell fate changes and population heterogeneity.},

@article{Tantale2016,
abstract = {Live-cell imaging has revealed unexpected features of gene expression. Here using improved single-molecule RNA microscopy, we show that synthesis of HIV-1 RNA is achieved by groups of closely spaced polymerases, termed convoys, as opposed to single isolated enzymes. Convoys arise by a Mediator-dependent reinitiation mechanism, which generates a transient but rapid succession of polymerases initiating and escaping the promoter. During elongation, polymerases are spaced by few hundred nucleotides, and physical modelling suggests that DNA torsional stress may maintain polymerase spacing. We additionally observe that the HIV-1 promoter displays stochastic fluctuations on two time scales, which we refer to as multi-scale bursting. Each time scale is regulated independently: Mediator controls minute-scale fluctuation (convoys), while TBP-TATA-box interaction controls sub-hour fluctuations (long permissive/non-permissive periods). A cellular promoter also produces polymerase convoys and displays multi-scale bursting. We propose that slow, TBP-dependent fluctuations are important for phenotypic variability of single cells.},

abstract = {Transcription is a stochastic process occurring mostly in episodic bursts. Although the local chromatin environment is known to influence the bursting behavior on long timescales, the impact of transcription factors (TFs)-especially in rapidly inducible systems-is largely unknown. Using fluorescence insitu hybridization and computational models, we quantified the transcriptional activity of the proto-oncogene c-Fos with single mRNA accuracy at individual endogenous alleles. We showed that, during MAPK induction, the TF concentration modulates the burst frequency of c-Fos, whereas other bursting parameters remain mostly unchanged. By using synthetic TFs with TALE DNA-binding domains, we systematically altered different aspects of these bursts. Specifically, we linked the polymerase initiation frequency to the strength of the transactivation domain and the burst duration to the TF lifetime on the promoter. Our results show how TFs and promoter binding domains collectively act to regulate different bursting parameters, offering a vast, evolutionarily tunable regulatory range for individual genes. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},
