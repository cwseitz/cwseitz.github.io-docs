They worked fine for me on 2021-04-08.
See \cite{hambleton}, \cite{gerstenmaier}, and \cite{gerstenmaier2} in the REFERENCES.

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
@misc{hambleton,
  key = {Deep Space Gateway},
  title = {{Deep Space Gateway to Open Opportunities for Distant Destinations}},
  note = {Editor: Kathryn Hambleton},
  year = {2018},
  month = {August 24,},
  howpublished = {\url{https://www.nasa.gov/feature/deep-space-gateway-to-open-...}},
  organization = {NASA},
}
\end{verbatim}
}

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
@misc{gerstenmaier,
  author = {William H. Gerstenmaier},
  title = {{Progress in Defining the Deep Space Gateway and Transport Plan}},

I suggest using the following
(added a `2' to the key so they'd have separate entries in the references.).
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
@misc{gerstenmaier2,
  author = {William H. Gerstenmaier},
  date = {2017-03},
  title = {{Progress in Defining the Deep Space Gateway and Transport Plan}},

  organization = {NASA},
}
\end{verbatim}
}
