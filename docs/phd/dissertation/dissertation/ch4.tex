\section{Background on chromatin imaging}

Chromatin is a complex and dynamic structure that packages eukaryotic DNA with histones. The higher-order structure of chromatin is highly non-random and plays an important role in regulation of genomic functions such as gene expression, DNA synthesis, and DNA repair. Chromatin structure is strictly controlled and constantly remodeled as cells differentiate, divide, and respond to genomic insults \parencite{Auerbach2009,Chien2009,Clapier2009,Misteli2007,Vidi2014}.

While DNA linearly encodes genetic information, serving as a template for RNA and protein production, the spatial and temporal organization of chromatin plays a fundamental role in determining intranuclear activities and gene stability \parencite{Cuvier2017,Dion2013}. For example, local structural fluctuations in nucleosomes on microsecond to second timescales transiently expose buried DNA sites, thus providing temporary access to interaction sites \parencite{Choy2012}. Similarly, chromatin fibers are subject to rapid conformational dynamics \parencite{Li2016}. This intrinsic motion of chromatin is closely linked to the underlying polymeric structure and directly affects molecular interactions at the local level by dictating the accessibility of DNA for various epigenetic effectors, chromatin regulators, and transcription factors (TFs). Indeed, the nanoscale spatiotemporal profile of chromatin may modulate the interaction of DNA with regulatory molecules, impacting the global patterns of gene expression \parencite{Bintu2018,Boettiger2016,Grant2018,Xu2018}. The dynamics of chromatin are best described by anomalous diffusion models \parencite{Fierz2019,Shukron2019}.

Most of what we know about local chromatin motion in chromatin remodeling has been derived from ensemble measurements, which provide a picture of biochemical access to chromatin over large populations of cells. Recently, advances using localization microscopy approaches have enabled the direct observation of the dynamics of individual molecules and the structure of chromatin domains in a single cell nucleus. These techniques, when paired with functional bioassays, permit the use of spatiotemporal localizations to make functional conclusions about genomic activities.

\subsection{Chromatin-associated-protein based labeling strategies}

Core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), the fundamental units of chromatin tightly wrapped by DNA molecules, are common targets for imaging. In fixed cells, chromatin-associated proteins can be visualized through immunostaining with antibodies \parencite{Conic2018,Ricci2015,Xu2018}. In live cells, histones can be directly fused with fluorescent proteins (FPs) \parencite{Belmont2001,Das2003,Kanda1998}. Photo-activatable fluorescent proteins have been developed, allowing real-time control and quantitative characterization of protein clustering. Such strategies can be combined with other technical advancements such as single-molecule tracking and super-resolution imaging \parencite{Cisse2013,Manley2008,Nozaki2017}. Alternatively, histone labeling in live cells can utilize prevalent self-label tags \parencite{Liss2015,Stagge2013}, such as Halo Tag, Snap Tag, CLIP tag, and TMP Tag. These offer advantages like small size, brightness, photostability, monomerization, and adjustable fluorescent dye concentration, demonstrating superior performance in single-molecule imaging \parencite{Grimm2017,Nagashima2019,Nozaki2017}. Other genomic elements can also be fluorescently labeled to assess structure and dynamics, including telomeres \parencite{Avogaro2018}, centromeres \parencite{Avogaro2018,Gasser2002}, H-NS or HU in E. coli \parencite{Wang2011}, heterochromatin proteins \parencite{Hu2013}, and transcription factors (TFs) \parencite{Elf2007,Gebhardt2013}.

\subsection{Sequence specific labeling strategies}

For fixed cell applications, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can detect and locate sequence-specific DNA or RNA in fixed cells using probes complementary to the target sequence \parencite{Bayani2004,Beliveau2015}. Primarily due to the need for cell permeabilization and sensitive hybridization conditions, FISH is limited to fixed cell samples.

Locus-specific labeling in live cells remains highly sought after. This can be achieved by either inserting artificial DNA sequences next to target genes, such as the repressor–operator array system (Lac operator (LacO) and Tet operator (TetO) systems), or by using modified genome-editing tools with inactive nucleases like zinc finger proteins (ZFPs), transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). The LacO-LacI-FP and TetO-TetI-FP systems are derived from the lactose and tetracycline operons of E. coli, respectively. Lac and Tet repressor proteins, fused to FPs, serve as tracking foci by recognizing repressor tandem repeat sequences inserted next to the position of interest \parencite{Ding2017,Loiodice2014}. Multiple systems and repressor segments can be utilized concurrently within a single cell to increase system multiplicity and fluorescent amplification \parencite{Backlund2014,Roukos2013,Tasan2018}.

Point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) techniques are appealing for localization microscopy due to their lack of photon budget restrictions. DNA-based PAINT \parencite{Jungmann2016} has been explored and refined over the past decade. Variants like Quantitative PAINT (qPAINT), Förster resonance energy transfer PAINT (FRET-PAINT) \parencite{Jungmann2016}, and Exchange PAINT have been developed to generalize the use of DNA origami for revealing cellular interactions. However, any intrusive DNA insertion can potentially disrupt function and alter chromatin locus position and mobility. 

Non-intrusive methods, such as ZFPs, TALEs, and CRISPR-dCas9, avoid these constraints by operating without artificial DNA insertion \parencite{Chen2016,Lindhout2007,Ma2013}. These systems rely on modular proteins with specific DNA recognition, with endonuclease-deficient proteins typically fused with FPs to serve as detectable signals. Among these strategies, CRISPR imaging systems are gaining considerable attention. Chen et al. re-engineered the type II system to visualize both repetitive elements in telomeres and the non-repetitive MUC4 \parencite{Chen2013}. For multicolor imaging within the CRISPR system, one strategy involves using fluorescent Cas9 orthologs from different bacterial species simultaneously, such as Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9), Neisseria meningitidis (NmCas9), and Streptococcus thermophilus (St1Cas9) \parencite{Ma2015}. Another strategy involves engineering single-guide RNA (sgRNA) into a scaffold RNA (scRNA) to encode information about the gene of interest and multiple fluorescent reporters \parencite{Zalatan2015}. Recent modifications to CRISPR imaging systems, such as CRISPR-display \parencite{Shechner2015} and CRISPR-rainbow \parencite{Ma2016}, indicate promising applications for investigating chromatin organization and visualizing genome instability and rearrangement \parencite{Chen2016}.


\subsection{Instrumentation for chromatin imaging}

Spatial and temporal resolution of nuclear imaging strategies are critical experimental conditions which dominate the reliability of downstream biophysical analysis \parencite{Burov2013}. Therefore, for most reported work in intranucleus chromatin imaging, objectives with high numerical aperture are employed. For many imaging experiments, an epi-illumination fluorescent microscope equipped with a modern camera (EMCCD or sCMOS) can provide time-course recording of live cells. Additionally, emerging LED light sources are replacing laser excitation in these microscopes, which significantly reduces the cost of the microscope \parencite{Albeanu2008,Hattori2009,Zheng2013}. Confocal microscopy is another widely applicable imaging system for chromatin imaging, which offers quality z-sectioning capability to reduce out-of-focus background. However, the applicability of confocal microscopy for the study of chromatin structure can be limited do to the reduced frame rate \parencite{Shukron2019}. Confocal microscopy suffers from intrinsic limitations such as photo-bleaching/photo-toxicity and poor temporal resolution, which restrict their applications for sensitive chromatin imaging at the single-molecule level.

Light sheet illumination offers solutions to the aforementioned challenges and achieves a balance among spatiotemporal resolution, photo-bleaching effects, and background reduction. The technique has garnered tremendous attention for its advantages in reducing phototoxicity, enhancing sectioning capability, and enabling live-cell three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Early iterations of light sheet microscopy has shown great performance for 3D imaging of tissues, embryos, and organs \parencite{Keller2015,Keller2010,Keller2008,Tomer2011}. However, its application has been limited by the geometric hindrance of using two objectives. Single objective live sheet methods such as the oblique plane microscope \parencite{Sapoznik2020}, as well as light-sheet analogues which generate a highly inclined and laminated optical sheet (HILO) for single-molecule imaging \parencite{Tokunaga2008}. An AFM cantilever was initially used to reflect the illumination light sheet by 90 degrees to bypass geometric hindrance \parencite{Gebhardt2013}. A similar idea was proposed using a microfabricated reflecting chip next to the sample reservoir \parencite{Galland2015}. Furthermore, the lattice light sheet (LLS) microscope, which generates the light sheet with a Bessel beam, significantly reduces the thickness of the light sheet to 300 nm \parencite{Chen2014}. The LLS has demonstrated superior performance in terms of spatial resolution, temporal resolution, phototoxicity, and sensitivity \parencite{Gao2019}.


It is worth noting that a significant portion of studies address chromatin structure and dynamics in only two dimensions. While two-dimensional measurements (i.e., positions or trajectories projected in a single plane) are practical and generally well-suited for flat nuclei in monolayer cell cultures, 3D measurements are necessary to improve accuracy, particularly for round nuclei where the relationship between 2D and 3D distances deteriorates, and for short distances (<5 um) where the average 2D/3D discrepancy is ~30 percent \parencite{Finn2017}. Moreover, nuclear inhomogeneity in all 3 dimensions must be considered. For motion measurements, the 2D/3D discrepancy of ~30 percent might not be very significant, but considering local fluctuations of ~50 nm, the 3D nature cannot be ignored.

Advances in super-resolution imaging will also benefit intranuclear chromatin imaging. For example, aspherical optics were initially utilized in super-resolution imaging to convert the z-axis position of a single molecule into a distorted point spread function (PSF) on the x-y plane using a cylindrical lens \parencite{Huang2008}. This method was further developed in single-molecule imaging/tracking to register the 3D position of a moving molecule through a rotational PSF \parencite{Greengard2006,Pavani2009,Badieirostami2010,Thompson2010}. Additionally, applying super-resolution imaging to live-cell single-molecule imaging produces high-density trajectories of molecules, enabling the integration of biophysical analysis such as stochastic models of nonequilibrium motions to recover forces, subcellular organizations, diffusion kinetics, and other biophysical features at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution \parencite{Hoze2012,Holcman2015,Hoze2015}.


\section{The structure of chromatin nanodomains}

\label{fig:fig16}
\end{figure}


Super-resolved nucleosome organization has been studied extensively in fixed cells to reveal segregated
nanodomains hundreds of nanometers in size, including dispersed nanodomains and compact large aggregates. Nucleosomes are now known to assemble into heterogeneous clusters of variable sizes, interspersed with nucleosome-depleted regions \parencite{Ricci2015}. However, our current understanding of nucleosome patterning in the nucleus is limited by the need for fixation. Chemical fixation with paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, methanol, or other chemical fixatives may alter the structure of chromatin, introducing error in our measurements \parencite{Maeshima2020}. Live cell imaging carries its own issues, particularly due to local and long-range chromatin motions in the nucleus. At the nanoscale, local chromatin motion appears to be isotropic and driven by thermal fluctuation \parencite{Maeshima2020}. Therefore, we presume that for sufficiently brief imaging duration (tens of seconds) nanodomain structure is approximately static. As a consequence, vibrations of single nucleosomes are, in effect, an addition of low amplitude noise to the localization dataset. 

To perform live cell super-resolution imaging of chromatin nanodomains, we adopt the HaloTag system, a modified haloalkane dehalogenase designed to covalently bind to synthetic ligands (Los 2008). The HaloTag protein is fused to nucleosome H2B and is then bound by a rhodomine-derived fluorescent ligand, JF646 (Grimm 2015). JF646 undergoes fluorescence intermittency (blinking) in the presence of a cysteamine (MEA) containing buffer (Figure \ref{fig:fig16}). Once precise positions of the fluorophores are obtained, Besag’s L-function $L(r)$ is used to analyze the clustering. The L-function $L(r)= \sqrt{\frac{K(r)}{\pi}}$ is a transformation of Ripley’s K-function $K(r)$. The function $K(r)$ is designed such that $K(r)$ is the number of localizations within a radius $r$ of a randomly chosen localization. Importantly, in the case of complete spatial randomness, $L(r)=r$. Thus, in general, to quantify the degree of clustering, one uses $L(r)-r$, which measures the deviation of a point pattern from CSR. To demonstrate this, example point patterns have been generated under CSR (Figure \ref{fig:fig17}) and a Thomas point process (Figure \ref{fig:fig18}).

\section{Polymer models and chromatin dynamics}

By accumulating single molecule localizations over a time series of frames, quantitative information regarding the motion of the particle can be extracted and related to experimental conditions. It is important to note that the chromatin structure is highly complex and cannot be exactly represented by the diffusion of individual particles. However, by treating each fluorescent spot as a point mapped in space and time, we can extract parameters of the diffusion and classify tracks as sub-diffusive, Brownian, or super diffusive. 

The well-known diffusion equation is a special case of the more general Kramers-Moyal expansion, which describes the dynamics of the probability density of a stochastic process $P(x,t)$. Pure diffusion is the case where transitions in the process are drawn from a distribution with zero mean (zero drift) and constant variance. 

\begin{align}
\frac{\partial P(x,t)}{\partial t}  &= D\frac{\partial^{2}P(x,t)}{\partial x^{2}}
\end{align}

The diffusion coefficient $D$ is in fact just half of the variance of the transition distribution $D = \sigma^{2}/2$. We would like to solve the above equation, but it is a PDE which usually require some tricks to solve e.g., integral transforms. This particular PDE can be solved by Fourier transformation. For brevity, I simply state the result

\begin{align*}
P(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2Dt}}\exp\left(- \frac{(x-x_{0})^{2}}{4Dt}\right)
\end{align*}

which is a Gaussian distribution will time-dependent variance $\sigma=4Dt$, given originally by Einstein in his famous paper on Brownian motion in 1905. The most common method to analyze single particle trajectories is to calculate the mean square displacement (MSD), which can be used to determine the diffusion coefficient $D$.

\begin{equation}
\text{MSD} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ \mathbf{r}(t + \tau) - \mathbf{r}(t) \right]^2
\end{equation}

The sampling time given by $\tau$ is interpreted as the frame rate of the camera. Certain studies have shown that the observed motion varies with different values of $\tau$ \parencite{Amitai2017,Shukron2017}. It is not difficult to see that the solution to the diffusion equation has a linear MSD: $\text{MSD}(\tau) = 4Dt$. A linear MSD is therefore a defining characteristic of Brownian motion. Sub-diffusive and super-diffusive diffusion can be classified by use of the more general anamalous diffusion model:

\begin{equation}
\text{MSD}(\tau) = 2mD\tau^\alpha
\end{equation}

where $m$ is the number of dimensions. For trajectories with $\alpha = 1$, the motion is considered to be Brownian motion; when $\alpha > 1$, it is said to be directed motion; and $\alpha < 1$ is classified as confined (or immobilized) diffusion. Importantly, different parameter values allow for further interpretation and classification of different diffusion modes of particles \parencite{Wasim2018,Zhong2020}.

By comparing the $D$ values of all particles within the nucleus, spatial heterogeneity can be clarified. While the calculation of $D$ and $\alpha$ is particularly reliant on the length of the trajectory and the number of data points, recent investigations have built diffusion color maps of fluorescently labeled histones by computing vast amounts of super-resolution trajectories \parencite{Amitai2017,Barth2020,Nozaki2017}.

\subsection{Trajectory linking}

A diverse set of particle tracking algorithms utilize probabilistic models of particle motion in order to add detected particles to existing tracks. Perhaps the most fundamental particle tracking method in this category is the nearest neighbor (NN) linking algorithm first introduced by Crocker and Grier. The algorithm constructs particle trajectories by assuming that the ensemble consists of non-interacting indistinguishable particles undergoing Brownian motion. As a result, the displacement of each particle follows a Gaussian distribution, parameterized by the diffusion coefficient and the time-resolution of the sequence. The most probable assignment of detected particles to existing tracks can then be found by maximizing the product of several Gaussian distributions \parencite{Crocker1996}. An attractive feature of this algorithm is that it is relatively simple to implement; however, assumptions that underlie the method impose limitations. In particular, if a typical displacement $\delta$ in one time step is comparable to the typical inter-particle spacing, tracking becomes highly error-prone \parencite{Crocker1996}. In other words, when particles are simultaneously densely distributed and undergoing fast diffusion, the algorithm can fail to build accurate trajectories due to the ambiguity introduced by overlapping trajectories. This also applies to the limit of low frame rates when small displacements are not recorded by the sensor. Importantly, the method alone cannot handle cases where particles disappear permanently, temporarily disappear due to blinking, photo-bleaching, or missed localization \parencite{Sbalzarini2005}.

\subsection{Chromatin polymer models}

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{\textbf{Snapshots of the Rouse polymer}. Four perspectives of the Rouse polymer generated with $N=2000$ beads connected with harmonic bonds with equilibrium length $200\mathrm{nm}$. Polymer is initialized with all harmonic bonds at equilibrium}
\label{fig:fig19}
\end{figure}


It is well-known that the DNA double helix structure consists of millions of base pairs chained together by the sugar-phosphate backbone. DNA, being a molecule built from many similar monomers bonded together, is naturally analyzed using a polymer model. The simplest polymer model for chromatin is the Rouse polymer model, which discretizes it into monomers connected by springs, resembling the string-of-beads structure observed under the electron microscope. Various forces acting on chromatin result in constrained dynamics, leading to significant variability in the anomalous exponent $\alpha$ for the dynamics of a chromatin locus.

To refine the modeling of chromatin properties according to the exponent $\alpha$, the $\beta$-polymer model was introduced. This model accounts for mid-range and long-range interactions between monomers, not just those between the nearest neighbors as in the Rouse polymer model. In this model, $\alpha$ shows a decay curve with distance along the chain. While $\alpha \sim 0.5$ in the traditional Rouse polymer model (Figure \ref{fig:fig19},\ref{fig:fig20}), the $\beta$-polymer model can be selected to address cases where $\alpha$ is in the range of 0 to 0.5 \parencite{Amitai2013,Amitai2017,Hajjoul2013}. Thus, local interactions between monomers can be inferred from the anomalous diffusion exponent using this construction.

Furthermore, as the polymer model usually folds at different spatial scales and generates various sizes of loops, a simulation model adding connectors between randomly chosen non-nearest neighbor monomer pairs, known as the randomly cross-linked (RCL) polymer model, was presented. In this model, $\alpha$ is reduced to below 0.5 by adding connectors. Recent evidence suggests that the number and distribution of connectors impact physical parameters in various ways, but this domain remains underexplored. Notably, the RCL polymer model may be crucial for studying dynamics in processes such as CTCF and cohesion regulating chromatin loop stability \parencite{Hansen2017}. Additionally, sub-diffusion with an exponent $\alpha > 0.5$ can occur in some polymer models, potentially involving different types of forces such as deterministic forces, directed motion, or other monomer interactions (self-avoiding and bending interactions).

\section{BRD4 regulates the structure of chromatin nanodomains}

The cell nucleus is a densely packed environment with chromatin comprising a dominant component. The compartmentalization of chromatin with other intranuclear components by phase separation is therefore an efficient strategy to ensure precise spatial and temporal coordination of complex dynamics. A growing number of phase separated nuclear bodies have been identified, including transcriptional condensates \parencite{Sabari2018,Hnisz2017}, nuclear speckles \parencite{Brown2008}, and DNA damage repair foci \parencite{Wang2023}; however, the interplay of phase separated condensates with the underlying chromatin structure remains poorly understood. Transcriptional condensates have been identified as an ideal model to study the kinetic and thermodynamic contributions of chromatin substrate binding, as the ability of transcriptional activators to both condense and bind chromatin is well established \parencite{Sabari2018,Wagh2021,Plys2018,Strom2024,Ma2021}. Here, we extend this effort by investigating the regulation of chromatin structure by phase separated transcriptional condensates. We focus on the BRD4 protein - a well-studied transcriptional activator that localizes to acetylated chromatin sites \parencite{Wu2018}, recruits pTEF-b, and initiates transcription of key genes involved in signal response, immunity, and oncogenesis \parencite{Itzen2014}.

The BRD4 long isoform is characterized by structured N-terminal tandem acetyl-lysine binding bromodomains and an extra-terminal domain, connected by intrinsically disordered regions \parencite{Han2020}. Perhaps the most fundamental of BRD4 functions is the ability to bind to acetylated chromatin through bromodomain 1 (BD1) and bromodomain 2 (BD2) that are in tandem within the N-terminal part of the protein (Figure \ref{fig:fig22}). BRD4 inhibitors such as (+)-JQ1 competitively bind to the acetyl-binding pocket of BRD4, displacing BRD4 from chromatin \parencite{Filippakopoulos2010}. It is also well known that BRD4 association with acetylated chromatin is enhanced by casein kinase II (CK2)-mediated phosphorylation of seven N-terminus phosphorylation sites (NPS), followed by intramolecular rearrangement of BRD4 protein and/or BRD4 dimerization \parencite{Wu2013,Malvezzi2021}.

\begin{figure}[t]

(b) Heat map of expected position error in AlphaFold prediction}
\label{fig:fig22}
\end{figure}

Recent studies have demonstrated that BRD4 is present in discrete nuclear bodies that occur at super-enhancers, which exhibit properties of other well-studied biomolecular condensates, including rapid recovery of fluorescence after photobleaching and sensitivity to 1,6-hexanediol, which disrupts liquid-like condensates \parencite{Sabari2018}. Both BRD4 long and short isoform are found in phase separated condensates in the nucleus and are associated with active gene transcription1. Importantly, CK2-mediated NPS phosphorylation state regulates chromatin binding activity of BRD413 as well as BRD4 phase separation \parencite{Han2020}. This has led to the conclusion that phosphorylation of BRD4 inhibits interaction with chromatin and reduces phase separation, while remaining necessary for active gene transcription. Moreover, phosphorylated and unphosphorylated BRD4 form different molecular associations – transient polyvalent associations of unphosphorylated BRD4 contrast with the stable dimeric interaction and chromatin binding of phosphorylated BRD4 \parencite{Malvezzi2021}. We therefore speculated that BRD4 chromatin binding may be necessary for maintaining NN structure and single nucleosome dynamics. 


\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Colocalization of BRD4 mutants with nucleosome nanodomains}

To address the role of BRD4 binding and phase separation on chromatin structure, we express FLAG-tagged BRD4 mutants with NPS or bromodomain mutations in HeLa cells and measure their effects on chromatin organization. In particular, we express a constitutively phosphorylated (7D mutant), constitutively unphosphorylated (7A mutant), and bromodomain-deactivated (BD mutant) protein (Figure \ref{fig:fig23} a,b,c). Colocalization analysis of BRD4 mutants with NNs using nearest neighbor distance distribution showed an obvious colocalization of these mutants with NNs. The 7D mutant showed the closest proximity to NNs relative to wild type, followed by BD and 7A mutants (Figure \ref{fig:fig23} d).  This result is consistent with known dependence of BRD4 chromatin binding on phosphorylation state.

\end{figure}
	
\subsubsection{Chromatin structure and dynamics}

To assess the functional role of BRD4 in maintaining the NN environment, we interrogated the dynamics of NNs, as well as their structure, in the presence of BRD4 mutants. Histone H2B was tagged with HaloTag \parencite{Los2008} (H2B-Halo), to which a fluorescent ligand JaneliaFluor646 (JF646) can bind speciﬁcally in a living cell. Low concentrations of JF646 were used to obtain sparse labeling of nucleosomes for single-nucleosome imaging (Figure \ref{fig:fig26} a,b). JF646-labeled nucleosomes in HeLa cells were recorded at 10fps (∼200 frames, 20 s total) and a reduced diffusion coefficient was measured in cells expressing 7A, 7D, and BD mutants, with respect to cells expressing the wild-type BRD4 protein (Figure \ref{fig:fig26} c). HeLa cells exposed to (+)-JQ1 in DMSO for 8h showed an increase in nucleosome dynamics with respect to DMSO alone (Figure \ref{fig:fig26} d). We then conducted super resolution imaging of nucleosome nanodomains using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) by promoting JF646 fluorescence intermittency with a cysteamine buffer (Figure \ref{fig:fig25} a,b). JF646 is known to exhibit a transient fluorescent state lasting tens to hundreds of milliseconds and stable dark state lasting hundreds of milliseconds to seconds \parencite{Grimm2015}. Two color imaging of H2B-Halo-JF646 and GFP-tagged BRD4 shows that BRD4 and NNs form complementary biomolecular condensates in the nucleus, consistent with current models of BRD4 chromatin reading mechanism (Figure \ref{fig:fig25} c). Ensemble averages of Besag’s L-function showed an increase in nucleosome clustering in cells expressing the 7D BRD4 mutants, while all other groups were consistently indistinguishable from WT cells (Figure \ref{fig:fig25} e). HeLa cells exposed to (+)-JQ1 in DMSO for 8h showed a reduction in nucleosome clustering with respect to DMSO alone (Figure \ref{fig:fig25} f).

\subsubsection{Heteropolymer model}

To interpret our experimental findings, we adopt a heteropolymer chromatin model to capture the interaction of chromatin with multivalent BRD4-like binders (Figure \ref{fig:fig24} a). The heteropolymer consists of a coarse-grained bead-and-spring chain composed of $N_b=200$ beads, connected by harmonic bonds with equilibrium length $r_0$ whose energy is deﬁned as

\begin{equation*}
U_{AB}(r_{ij})=\frac{\kappa}{2}(\lvert r_{ij}\lvert-r_0)^2
\end{equation*}

where $r_{ij}$ is a vector connecting the center of a bead of type $i$ to a bead of type $j$ and $i,j \in (A,B)$. In all simulations, we assume $\kappa=90k_{B}T{r_0}^2$ where $k_{B}$ is Boltzmann’s constant and $r_0=200$nm. Random beads in the chain are selected to represent locally unacetylated (A-type particles) and acetylated chromatin (B-type particles).  B-type particles undergo multivalent interactions with a third group of C-type particles, which can promote cross-linking of the polymer. We presume a Bernoulli probably of $p=0.3$ for any given bead to be in an acetylated-like state. Interaction of multivalent chromatin binders with chromatin beads are then mediated by the following potential:

\begin{equation*}
U_{BC}\left(r_{ij}\right)=\epsilon\left(1-\left(\frac{\lvert r_{ij}\lvert}{R_0}\right)^2\right)^3
\end{equation*}

where $R_0=200$nm. The potential $U_{BC}$ is considered over a domain $0\leq\lvert r_{ij}\lvert\leq 2 R_0$ In all simulations, ten replicates were run for each condition tested. A and B type particles within the chromatin polymer have repulsive interactions with $\epsilon = +10k_{B}T$. Binding energy of the acetylated beads with binders was varied with $\epsilon_{I} = 0 k_{B}T,\epsilon_{II} = -20k_{B}T,\epsilon{III}=-40k_{B}T$ (Figure \ref{fig:fig24} a). The dynamics of chromatin chains are approximated by Brownian dynamics within a cubic box with side length of 10um and periodic boundary conditions. Brownian dynamics follows the stochastic differential equation.

where $\gamma$ is a diagonal friction tensor and $\xi(t)$ is a three-dimensional delta-correlated white noise $\langle \xi(t)\xi(t+\tau)  = \delta(t,t+\tau)$. Integrating the Brownian dynamics showed an overall reduction of the variance of the diffusion coefficient $D$ of single beads, and linear scaling of the diffusion coefficient with respect to temperature (Figure \ref{fig:fig24} e).

\subsection{Discussion}

Our data support the model that phosphorylated and unphosphorylated BRD4 form different molecular associations in the nucleus. BRD4 nuclear localization is only weakly affected by bromodomain inhibition with monovalent BET inhibitors, while exposure to phase separation inhibitors such as 1,6 Hexanediol have a significant effect on BRD4 localization in the nucleus11. Colocalization activity of 7A/7D mutants relative to wild type measured here is consistent with this model of BRD4 localization to nucleosome nanodomains. Strong colocalization of the BD mutant relative to the wild type suggests a possible link between bromodomain structure with localization of BRD4. 

Concurrently, reduced diffusivity of single nucleosomes with all mutants tested suggests a relationship between elevated colocalization and the degree of confinement of nanodomain diffusion. At the same time, increased nucleosome diffusivity and reduced nucleosome clustering after (+)-JQ1 exposure indicate BRD4 condensate formation is necessary in maintaining the nanodomain architecture. We further hypothesize effects of BRD4 localization on the viscosity of the nanodomain environment and potentially increased cross-linking of nanodomains. Indeed, we find this to be a natural result of molecular crowding resulting from overexpression of a constitutively phase separating protein, capable of multivalent interactions. Substantial colocalization of the 7D mutant with nanodomains along with increased chromatin compaction points towards a BRD4-mediated cross-linking mechanism of nucleosomes within the nanodomain. This result of increased affinity can also be seen in coarse grained simulations of chromatin interactions with multivalent binders.
 
We conclude that nascent BRD4 condensates are likely seeded by promiscuous interactions of BRD4 with cofactors, followed by phosphorylation followed by chromatin interactions mediated by the phosphorylated form. The stable dimeric interaction and binding of phosphorylated BRD4 to acetylated chromatin would then mediate control of the chromatin architecture by promoting cross-linking of the chromatin fiber and acting a molecular ‘bridge’ between transcriptional condensates with chromatin. 



\subsection{Materials and Methods}

\subsubsection{Cell lines, cell culture conditions, and transfection}

HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 percent fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37C 5 percent CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cultures were tested routinely for mycoplasma contamination; all tests were negative. For super-resolution experiments, cells were seeded in a 35mm FluoroDish (WPI), and transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 with pBREBACK-H2BHalo plasmid (Addgene plasmid 91564) (ThermoFisher), pcDNA5-Flag-BRD4-7A (Addgene Plasmid 90006), pcDNA5-Flag-BRD4-7D (Addgene Plasmid 90007), pCDNA5-Flag-BRD4-BD (Addgene Plasmid 90005), pcDNA5-Flag-BRD4-WT (Addgene Plasmid 90331)

\subsubsection{Super-resolution imaging of nucleosome nanodomains in living cells}

After transient transfection, H2B-Halotag HeLa cells were incubated with 3pM JF646 HaloTag ligand overnight. Cells were imaged in a dSTORM photoswitching buffer containing 100mM MEA, 50 ug/ml Glucose Oxidase, and 3.4 mg/ml Catalase (Sigma). Buffer pH was adjusted to ~8 using HCl. Movies were collected using a custom Olympus IX83 microscope body equipped with an Olympus 60X 1.25NA oil-immersion objective. During imaging cells were maintained at 37C and 5 percent CO2 in a stage top incubator (Tokai Hit). Images were projected onto an ORCA-Fusion sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu) and 2000 frames were captured at 100fps. The microscope was controlled using Micromanager software. HaloTag-JF646 molecules were imaged using oblique illumination with a 640nm laser (Excelitas) held at 20mW, as measured at the back focal plane of the objective. Super resolution reconstructions were obtained using the ThunderSTORM ImageJ plugin. Background signal was subtracted using a rolling ball filter with radius of 10 pixels. Spots were fit using an integrated Gaussian point spread function model with maximum likelihood estimation \parencite{Smith2010,Huang2013}. Experimental conditions for single molecule tracking are nearly identical. However, H2B-Halotag HeLa cells were incubated with 3pM JF646 HaloTag ligand. HaloTag-JF646 molecules were illuminated at 10mW, 100 frames were captured at 10fps. 


\subsubsection{Colocalization of BRD4 mutants with nucleosome nanodomains}

We colocalize FLAG-tagged BRD4 mutants with nucleosome nanodomains by simultaneous FLAG immunofluorescence with imaging of sparsely labeled of H2B-JF646. Puncta were detected in both channels using the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) detection algorithm to generate a multi-type point pattern. We then computed the nearest neighbor distance distribution as the distance from a random H2B-JF646 puncta to the nearest BRD4-FLAG puncta. Nearest distances values were pooled over N=10 cells for each mutant. 

\subsubsection{Single molecule tracking}

Nucleosomes were localized using an integrated Gaussian point spread function model with maximum likelihood estimation \parencite{Smith2010,Huang2013} and tracked using TrackPy Python software.  Trajectories lasting less than 80 frames were removed from further analysis. The individual mean squared displacement (MSD) is computed as $\langle \Delta r^{2}\rangle = \frac{1}{\lvert S_{\tau}\lvert}\sum_{\Delta r \in S_{\tau}}(\Delta r)^{2}$
where $S_\tau$ is the set of all displacements in a time interval $\tau$. The diffusion coefficient for both simulations as well as experimental data was computed by linear regression of the formula $\log\langle \Delta r^{2}\rangle  = \log 4D + \alpha \log \tau$

\subsubsection{Immunofluorescence}
Cells grown in 35mm dishes were fixed with Formaldehyde in 1xPBS at 37C incubator for 20 minutes, and then permeabilized with 0.3 percent (v/v) Triton-X100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS and blocked for 1h in 5 percent (w/v) nonfat dry milk at 4C. Cells were incubated overnight at 4C using primary antibodies anti-FLAG (Cell Signaling, clone XXX; 1:1000), and anti-BRD4 (Cell Signaling, clone E2A7X; 1:1000)  in blocker. Secondary antibodies for BRD4 (Cell Signaling Anti-Mouse IgG-Alexa488, 1:1000) were used. 

\subsubsection{Immunoblotting}
Cells were washed and lysis buffer added (RIPA buffer: PMSF: protease inhibitor cocktail: orthovanadate=100:1:2:1). Cells were then scraped and sonicated for 15 seconds using an ultrasonic homogenizer. Lysate was centrifuged at high speed (13200r/min) for 15 minutes at 4C to pellet the cellular debris. Total protein concentration was determined by a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). For electrophoresis, protein samples were prepared according to a protein-4x loading buffer (containing DTT) ratio of 3:1, 4x loading buffer containing DTT was diluted with 3 aliquots of protein sample. The sample was mixed and heated at 95C for 5 min, followed by vortex and centrifuge. After running the gel, it was removed from the cassette and assembled inside the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System cassette. Transfer was run at 2.5A and 25V for 7mins. The sample was then blocked for at least 1 hour using 5 percent skim milk blocking solution prepared with PBS in RT. Primary FLAG antibody was diluted in PBST with 3 percent skim milk (1:500) and incubated at 4C overnight. The secondary antibody (Licor Anti-Mouse IgG- IRDye 800CW) was diluted in PBST with 3 percent skim milk (1:5000) and placed on a rocker and incubated at RT for 45min. Western blots on Nitrocellulose membranes were scanned using the Odyssey fluorescence scanning system software.

\section{A potential application of sequence specific SR in immune evasion}

Chromatin imaging strategies discussed so far in this chapter are capable tools for genome-wide structural analyses. Recent developments in labeling technologies have extended this approach further, making sequence specific super-resolution approaches possible. For example, OligoSTORM \parencite{Beliveau2017} is a super-resolution imaging strategy that reveals the distribution of nucleosomes within specific genes, through the simultaneous visualization of DNA and histones. OligoSTORM is based on in-situ hybridization, taking advantage of array-derived oligonucleotide (oligo) probes. OligoSTORM reconstructs the trajectory of a genomic region of interest by tiling the region with approximately 100 to 100,000 or more species of oligos, each carrying either a fluorophore or a binding site for a fluorescently labeled secondary oligo \parencite{Boettiger2016, Beliveau2017}. Custom oligo probes can now be amplified from a dsDNA library and fluorescently labeled at relatively low cost. In this process, an unlabeled dsDNA oligo library up to approximately 100nt in length can be purchased from a commercial vendor, followed by T7 in-vitro transcription to ssRNA followed by addition of fluorescently modified primers and reverse transcription \parencite{Murgha2015,Boettiger2020}. This method may allow us to link local chromatin structures with cellular states, for example resistant states of cancer cells to immune recognition.

Immune evasion involves numerous mechanisms at molecular and cellular levels, including genetic and epigenetic heterogeneities. A primary mechanism by which tumor cells suppress the immune assault is by enhanced expression of PD-L1 ligand for the PD-1 immune inhibiting checkpoint. Binding of PD-L1 to its receptor PD-1 on activated T cells inhibits anti-tumor immunity by counteracting T cell-activating signals, thereby suppressing antitumor immune activity. Antibody-based ICB treatments utilize PD-1-PD-L1 inhibitors to target this mechanism and can induce durable tumor remissions in patients in various cancers. However, the development of resistance to ICB treatment raises important questions regarding the fundamental determinants of PD-L1 expression. Furthermore, IFN-$\gamma$, a soluble cytokine and prominent inducer of PD-L1 expression, has surfaced as an important mediator for adaptive resistance to ICB by facilitating nuclear translocation and phase separation of key markers of immune resistance and tumor progression. Indeed, IFN-$\gamma$ has been shown to promote the expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP) - a key component of phase-separated droplets in the nucleus which can influence PD-L1 expression. Interestingly, PD-L1 expression itself is regulated by YAP and BRD4, both key components of transcriptional condensates, alongside a super-enhancer (SE) PD-L1L2-SE. I speculate that IFN-$\gamma$ signaling promotes PD-L1 expression by way of BRD4 and YAP-dependent phase separation of PD-L1, PD-L2, and PD-L1L2-SE loci and associated proteins.

\label{fig:fig31}
\end{figure}

Elevated PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment is one of several avenues towards immune evasion, yet there remain many unsolved problems related to how elevated expression is achieved.  In general, the development of tumor tolerance is frequently regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. DNA methylation downregulates antigen processing and presentation molecules, leading to immune escape and a reduction in sensitivity of the tumor cells to immunotherapy \parencite{Li2021}. Transient histone demethylation can also allow cells to survive drug exposure, that is, the tolerant state is transient and reversible. Gene editing recently revealed that transcription of PD-L1 and PD-L2 gene expression in regulated by a novel super-enhancer PD-L1L2-SE \parencite{Xu2019}. Super-enhancers are complexes made of multiple enhancer elements, transcription factors, and mediating structural proteins which phase separate in so-called transcriptional condensates to stimulate amplified expression of genes defining cell identity. For this reason, SEs are of considerable interest in cancer and are now known to be a tool for tumor progression and adaptive resistance \parencite{Xu2019}. Given these findings, I further speculate that IFN-$\gamma$ exposure induces structural variants of PD-L1/PD-L2/PD-L1L2-SE loci, driven in part by phase separation of YAP and BRD4. Both are key components of transcriptional condensates and have been implicated in PD-L1 expression; however, whether they act directly or indirectly is largely unknown \parencite{Xu2019,Yu2021}.

Mechanisms contributing to PD-L1 expression are also of high importance for the clinical development of immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Chemotherapeutic treatment with (+)-JQ1 has been demonstrated to specifically inhibit super-enhancer component BRD4, dramatically decreased the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 in SUM-159 and MDA-MB-231 cells \parencite{Xu2019}. However, it remains unclear whether PD-L1 inhibition with JQ1 is indirect and what the role of BRD4 is, as SE structural modifications have not been directly observed. Furthermore, other potential IFN-$\gamma$ inducible SEs have also appeared in the literature, as observed by YAP puncta formation following IFN-$\gamma$ induction \parencite{Yu2021}. Phase separation has been directly observed for the Interferon-inducible guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) - a group interferon-inducible GTPases \parencite{Siwek2020}. The GBP locus has been colocalized with SE components MED1 and BRD4 with the GBP gene cluster in murine macrophages after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis \parencite{Lin2022}. Interestingly, inhibition of BRD4 chromatin binding activity after (+)-JQ1 exposure suppresses IFN-$\gamma$ induced expression of a member of the guanylate binding protein gene cluster (Figure \ref{fig:fig31}). Taken together, these results make several genomic loci, including PD-L1/PD-L2/PD-L1L2-SE, interesting candidates for super-resolution imaging and correlation of epigenetic states with IFN-$\gamma$ exposure.

In summary, there remain many potentially correlated factors which have not yet been demonstrated: (i) direct dependence of PD-L1/PD-L2/PD-L1L2-SE structure on the presence of BRD4 and YAP, (ii) the dependence of PD-L1/PD-L2/PD-L1L2-SE structure on IFN-$\gamma$ priming (iii) an association between PD-L1 transcriptional activity and PD-L1/PD-L2/PD-L1L2-SE structure. Potential conceptual innovations include: (i) A novel role for IFN-$\gamma$ signaling pathways inducing immune evasion by phase separation (ii) Phase separation as an important biophysical mechanism during the immune response. In terms of methodology, this work would provide the first application of super-resolution-based reconstruction of chromatin architecture in the context of the PD-L1 axis and phase separation. This project also will continue ongoing development of novel chromatin architecture reconstruction algorithms to be shared with the scientific community.
