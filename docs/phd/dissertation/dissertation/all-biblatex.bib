   abstract = {Recent psychophysical experiments indicate that humans perform near-optimal Bayesian inference in a wide variety of tasks, ranging from cue integration to decision making to motor control. This implies that neurons both represent probability distributions and combine those distributions according to a close approximation to Bayes' rule. At first sight, it would seem that the high variability in the responses of cortical neurons would make it difficult to implement such optimal statistical inference in cortical circuits. We argue that, in fact, this variability implies that populations of neurons automatically represent probability distributions over the stimulus, a type of code we call probabilistic population codes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Poisson-like variability observed in cortex reduces a broad class of Bayesian inference to simple linear combinations of populations of neural activity. These results hold for arbitrary probability distributions over the stimulus, for tuning curves of arbitrary shape and for realistic neuronal variability. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

Information theory is useful for understanding preprocessing, in terms of predictive coding in the retina and principal component analysis and decorrelation processing in early visual cortex. The chapter introduces some concepts from information theory. In particular, the entropy of a random variable and the mutual information between two random variables are focused. One of the major uses for information theory has been in interpretation and guidance for unsupervised neural networks: networks that are not provided with a teacher or target output that they are to emulate. The chapter describes how information relates to the more familiar supervised learning schemes, and discusses the use of error back propagation (BackProp) to minimize mean squared error (MSE) in a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Other distortion measures are possible in place of MSE. In particular, the information theoretic cross-entropy distortion has been focused in the chapter. © 1993, Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This variability is most often interpreted as 'noise', purely detrimental to the sensory system. In this paper, we propose an alternative view in which the variability is related to the uncertainty, about world parameters, which is inherent in the sensory stimulus. Specifically, the responses of a population of neurons are interpreted as stochastic samples from the posterior distribution in a latent variable model. In addition to giving theoretical arguments supporting such a representational scheme, we provide simulations suggesting how some aspects of response variability might be understood in this framework.},

   abstract = {Abstract Multiple lines of evidence support the notion that the brain performs probabilistic inference in multiple cognitive domains, including perception and decision mak- ing. There is also evidence that probabilistic inference may be implemented in the brain through the (quasi-)stochastic activity of neural circuits, producing samples from the appropriate posterior distributions, effectively implementing a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. However, time becomes a fundamental bottleneck in such sampling-based probabilistic representations: the quality of inferences de- pends on how fast the neural circuit generates new, uncorrelated samples from its stationary distribution (the posterior). We explore this bottleneck in a sim- ple, linear-Gaussian latent variable model, in which posterior sampling can be achieved by stochastic neural networks with linear dynamics. The well-known Langevin sampling (LS) recipe, so far the only sampling algorithm for continu- ous variables of which a neural implementation has been suggested, naturally fits into this dynamical framework. However, we first show analytically and through simulations that the symmetry of the synaptic weight matrix implied by LS yields critically slow mixing when the posterior is high-dimensional. Next, using meth- ods from control theory, we construct and inspect networks that are optimally fast, and hence orders of magnitude faster than LS, while being far more biologically plausible. In these networks, strong – but transient – selective amplification of external noise generates the spatially correlated activity fluctuations prescribed by the posterior. Intriguingly, although a detailed balance of excitation and inhibition is dynamically maintained, detailed balance of Markov chain steps in the resulting sampler is violated, consistent with recent findings on how statistical irreversibil- ity can overcome the speed limitation of random walks in other domains.},

   abstract = {A novel formalism for Bayesian learning in the context of complex inference models is proposed. The method is based on the use of the stationary Fokker-Planck (SFP) approach to sample from the posterior density. Stationary Fokker-Planck sampling generalizes the Gibbs sampler algorithm for arbitrary and unknown conditional densities. By the SFP procedure, approximate analytical expressions for the conditionals and marginals of the posterior can be constructed. At each stage of SFP, the approximate conditionals are used to define a Gibbs sampling process, which is convergent to the full joint posterior. By the analytical marginals efficient learning methods in the context of artificial neural networks are outlined.Offline and incremental Bayesian inference andmaximum likelihood estimation from the posterior are performed in classification and regression examples.Acomparison of SFPwith otherMonte Carlo strategies in the general problem of sampling from arbitrary densities is also presented. It is shown that SFP is able to jump large low-probability regions without the need of a careful tuning of any step-size parameter. In fact, the SFP method requires only a small set of meaningful parameters that can be selected following clear, problem-independent guidelines. The computation cost of SFP, measured in terms of loss function evaluations, grows linearly with the given model's dimension. © 2010 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

Here we demonstrate, using a large-scale cortical network model, that realistic synaptic plasticity rules coupled with homeostatic mechanisms lead to the formation of neuronal assemblies that reflect previously experienced stimuli. Further, reverberation of past evoked states in spontaneous spiking activity stabilizes, rather than erases, this learned architecture. Spontaneous and evoked spiking activity contains a signature of learned assembly structures, leading to testable predictions about the effect of recent sensory experience on spike train statistics.

   abstract = {The organization of computations in networks of spiking neurons in the brain is still largely unknown, in particular in view of the inherently stochastic features of their firing activity and the experimentally observed trial-to-trial variability of neural systems in the brain. In principle there exists a powerful computational framework for stochastic computations, probabilistic inference by sampling, which can explain a large number of macroscopic experimental data in neuroscience and cognitive science. But it has turned out to be surprisingly difficult to create a link between these abstract models for stochastic computations and more detailed models of the dynamics of networks of spiking neurons. Here we create such a link and show that under some conditions the stochastic firing activity of networks of spiking neurons can be interpreted as probabilistic inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Since common methods for MCMC sampling in distributed systems, such as Gibbs sampling, are inconsistent with the dynamics of spiking neurons, we introduce a different approach based on non-reversible Markov chains that is able to reflect inherent temporal processes of spiking neuronal activity through a suitable choice of random variables. We propose a neural network model and show by a rigorous theoretical analysis that its neural activity implements MCMC sampling of a given distribution, both for the case of discrete and continuous time. This provides a step towards closing the gap between abstract functional models of cortical computation and more detailed models of networks of spiking neurons. © 2011 Buesing et al.},

Dynamic excitatory–inhibitory balance is a plausible mechanism that generates such irregular activity, but it remains unclear how balance is achieved and maintained in plastic neural networks. In particular, it is not fully understood how plasticity induced changes in the network affect balance, and in turn, how correlated, balanced activity impacts learning. How do the dynamics of balanced networks change under different plasticity rules? How does correlated spiking activity in recurrent networks change the evolution of weights, their eventual magnitude, and structure across the network? To address these questions, we develop a theory of spike–timing dependent plasticity in balanced networks. We show that balance can be attained and maintained under plasticity–induced weight changes. We find that correlations in the input mildly affect the evolution of synaptic weights. Under certain plasticity rules, we find an emergence of correlations between firing rates and synaptic weights. Under these rules, synaptic weights converge to a stable manifold in weight space with their final configuration dependent on the initial state of the network. Lastly, we show that our framework can also describe the dynamics of plastic balanced networks when subsets of neurons receive targeted optogenetic input.},

We extend the analysis of balanced networks to include a connection probability that depends on the spatial separation between neurons. In the continuum limit, we derive that stable, balanced firing rate solutions require that the spatial spread of external inputs be broader than that of recurrent excitation, which in turn must be broader than or equal to that of recurrent inhibition. Notably, this implies that network models with broad recurrent inhibition are inconsistent with the balanced state. For finite size networks, we investigate the pattern-forming dynamics arising when balanced conditions are not satisfied.

We begin with a new definition of redundancy as the minimum information that any source provides about each possible outcome of the variable, averaged over all possible outcomes. We then show how this measure of redundancy induces a lattice over sets of sources that clarifies the general structure of multivariate information. Finally, we use this redundancy lattice to propose a definition of partial information atoms that exhaustively decompose the Shannon information in a multivariate system in terms of the redundancy between synergies of subsets of the sources. Unlike interaction information, the atoms of our partial information decomposition are never negative and always support a clear interpretation as informational quantities. Our analysis also demonstrates how the negativity of interaction information can be explained by its confounding of redundancy and synergy.},

Using a large stimulus set, we explored the impact that long-term experience has on the response properties of two classes of neurons in ITC: broad-spiking (putative excitatory) cells and narrow-spiking (putative inhibitory) cells. We found that experience increased maximum responses of putative excitatory neurons but had the opposite effect on maximum responses of putative inhibitory neurons, an observation that helps to reconcile contradictory reports regarding the presence and direction of this effect. In addition, we found that experience reduced the average stimulus-evoked response in both cell classes, but this decrease was much more pronounced in putative inhibitory units. This latter finding supports a potentially critical role of inhibitory neurons in detecting and initiating the cascade of events underlying adult neural plasticity in ITC. Woloszyn and Sheinberg show that long-term visual experience enhances activity of putative excitatory neurons in inferior temporal cortex but decreases global activity of putative inhibitory neurons.

It is therefore essential to understand quantitatively how CCFs are shaped by different factors, such as connectivity, synaptic parameters, and background activity. Here, we study the CCF between two neurons using analytical calculations and numerical simulations. We quantify the role of synaptic parameters, such as peak conductance, decay time, and reversal potential, and analyze how various patterns of connectivity influence CCF shapes. In particular, we find that the symmetry of the CCF distinguishes in general, but not always, the case of shared inputs between two neurons from the case in which they are directly synaptically connected. We systematically examine the influence of background synaptic inputs from the surrounding network that set the baseline firing statistics of the neurons and modulate their response properties. We find that variations in the background noise modify the amplitude of the cross-correlation function as strongly as variations of synaptic strength. In particular, we show that the postsynaptic neuron spiking regularity has a pronounced influence on CCF amplitude. This suggests an efficient and flexible mechanism for modulating functional interactions. Copyright © 2009 Society for Neuroscience.},

Unlike classical attractor neural network models, our model exhibits graded activity in retrieval states, with distributions of firing rates that are close to lognormal. Inferred learning rules are close to maximizing the number of stored patterns within a family of unsupervised Hebbian learning rules, suggesting that learning rules in ITC are optimized to store a large number of attractor states.

The environment is represented by the state of the gene (active or inactive). The protein population size is ruled by the birth-and-death process. Proteins can be produced by the gene when it is activated (birth). They can disappear as well due to their denaturation (death). The distribution of the protein number is computed explicitly for both the transient and stationary cases. It is shown that three out of the four parameters of the model can be estimated from an observed sample of protein numbers collected during the stationary regime. © 1995 Academic Press.

   abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (“annealing”) or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel “relaxation” algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios. © 1984, IEEE.},

IFNγ induces morphological changes in breast cancer (BC) cells with or without estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) expression. However, IFNγ-regulated genes in BC cells remain unexplored. Here, we performed a cDNA microarray analysis of MCF-7 (ERα+) and MDA-MB-231 (HER2-/PR-/ERα-) cells with and without IFNγ treatment. We identified specific IFNγ−modulated genes in each cell type, and a small group of genes regulated by IFNγ common in both cell types. IFNγ treatment for an extended time mainly repressed gene expression shared by both cell types. Nonetheless, some of these IFNγ-repressed genes were seemingly deregulated in human mammary tumor samples, along with decreased IFNGR1 (an IFNγ receptor) expression. Thus, IFNγ signaling-elicited anti-tumor activities may be mediated by the downregulation of main IFNγ target genes in BC; however, it may be deregulated by the tumor microenvironment in a tumor stage-dependent manner.},

   abstract = {A major difficulty in treating cancer is the inability to differentiate between normal and tumor cells. The immune system differentiates tumor from normal cells by T cell receptor (TCR) binding of tumor-associated peptides bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) molecules. The peptides, derived from the tumor-specific proteins, are presented by MHC proteins, which then serve as cancer markers. The TCR is a difficult protein to use as a recombinant protein because of production issues and has poor affinity for pMHC; therefore, it is not a good choice for use as a tumor identifier outside of the immune system. We constructed a synthetic antibody-fragment (Fab) library in the phage-display format and isolated antibody-fragments that bind pMHC with high affinity and specificity. One Fab, fE75, recognizes our model cancer marker, the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2/neu) peptide, E75, bound to the MHC called Human Leukocyte Antigen-A2 (HLA-A2), with nanomolar affinity. The fE75 bound selectively to E75/HLA-A2 positive cancer cell lines in vitro. The fE75 Fab conjugated with 64Cu selectively accumulated in E75/HLA-A2 positive tumors and not in E75/HLA-A2 negative tumors in an HLA-A2 transgenic mouse as probed using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging. Considering that hundreds to thousands of different peptides bound to HLA-A2 are present on the surface of each cell, the fact that fE75 arrives at the tumor at all shows extraordinary specificity. These antibody fragments have great potential for diagnosis and targeted drug delivery in cancer. © 2012 Miller et al.},

Their high specificity, the ease in production, favorable biophysical properties and the opportunity to engineer different properties make mAbs a versatile class of biologics. mAbs targeting peptide–major histocompatibility molecule (pMHC) complexes are often referred to as “TCR-like” mAbs, as pMHC complexes are generally recognized by T-cell receptors (TCRs). Presentation of self- and non-self-derived peptide fragments on MHC molecules and subsequent activation of T cells dictate immune responses in health and disease. This includes responses to infectious agents or cancer but also aberrant responses against harmless self-peptides in autoimmune diseases. The ability of TCR-like mAbs to target specific peptides presented on MHC allows for their use to study peptide presentation or for diagnosis and therapy. This extends the scope of conventional mAbs, which are generally limited to cell-surface or soluble antigens. Herein, we review the strategies used to generate TCR-like mAbs and provide a structural comparison with the analogous TCR in pMHC binding. We further discuss their applications as research tools and therapeutic reagents in preclinical models as well as challenges and limitations associated with their use.},

A recently developed method called MHC-associated peptide proteomics (MAPPs) uses liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify the peptide sequences derived from a therapeutic protein that are presented by major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) on antigen-presenting cells, and therefore may induce immunogenicity. In this study, we developed a MAPPs technique (called Ab-MAPPs) that has high throughput and can efficiently identify the MHC II-presented peptides derived from therapeutic antibodies using magnetic nanoparticle beads coated with a hydrophilic polymer in the immunoprecipitation process. The magnetic beads could identify more peptides and sequence regions originating from infliximab and adalimumab in a shorter measurement time than Sepharose beads, which are commonly used for MAPPs. Several sequence regions identified by Ab-MAPPs from infliximab corresponded to immunogenic sequences reported by other methods, which suggests the method’s high potential for identifying significant sequences involved in immunogenicity. Furthermore, our study suggests that the Ab-MAPPs method can recognize the difference of a single amino acid residue between similar antibody sequences with different levels of T-cell proliferation activity and can identify potentially immunogenic peptides with high binding affinity to MHC II. In conclusion, Ab-MAPPs is useful for identifying the immunogenic sequences of therapeutic antibodies and will contribute to the design of therapeutic antibodies with low immunogenicity during the drug discovery stage.},

Class II MHC proteins present their bound peptides to CD4+ T cells, thereby helping to activate both the humoral and the cellular arms of the adaptive immune response. Peptide loading onto class II MHC proteins is regulated temporally, spatially and developmentally in antigen-presenting cells. To help visualize these processes, we have developed a series of novel fluorogenic probes that incorporate the environment-sensitive amino acid analogs 6-N,N-dimethylamino-2- 3-naphthalimidoalanine and 4-N,N-dimethylaminophthalimidoalanine. Upon binding to class II MHC proteins these fluorophores show large changes in emission spectra, quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime. Peptides incorporating these fluorophores bind specifically to class II MHC proteins on antigen-presenting cells and can be used to follow peptide binding in vivo.

Here, we describe a molecular modeling study of MHC-peptide interactions that integrates sampling techniques from protein-protein docking, loop modeling, de novo structure prediction, and protein design in order to construct atomically detailed peptide binding landscapes for a diverse set of MHC proteins. Specificity profiles derived from these landscapes recover key features of experimental binding profiles and can be used to predict peptide binding with reasonable accuracy. Family wide comparison of the predicted binding landscapes recapitulates previously reported patterns of specificity divergence and peptiderepertoire diversity while providing a structural basis for observed specificity patterns. The size and sequence diversity of these structure-based binding landscapes enable us to identify subtle patterns of covariation between peptide sequence positions; analysis of the associated structural models suggests physical interactions that may mediate these sequence correlations.},

As neoepitopes are not subject to central immune tolerance and are not expressed in healthy tissues, they are attractive targets for therapeutic cancer vaccines. Because the vast majority of cancer mutations are unique to the individual patient, harnessing the full potential of this rich source of targets requires individualized treatment approaches. Many computational algorithms and machine-learning tools have been developed to identify mutations in sequence data, to prioritize those that are more likely to be recognized by T cells and to design tailored vaccines for every patient. In this Review, we fill the gaps between the understanding of basic mechanisms of T cell recognition of neoantigens and the computational approaches for discovery of somatic mutations and neoantigen prediction for cancer immunotherapy. We present a new classification of neoantigens, distinguishing between guarding, restrained and ignored neoantigens, based on how they confer proficient antitumour immunity in a given clinical context. Such context-based differentiation will contribute to a framework that connects neoantigen biology to the clinical setting and medical peculiarities of cancer, and will enable future neoantigen-based therapies to provide greater clinical benefit.},

Efforts to create high-dimensional biomarker catalogs of these cells have been largely based on single-cell sequencing approaches, which lack the spatial context required to understand critical cellular communication and correlated structural organization. To probe in situ biology with sufficient depth, several multiplexed protein imaging methods have been recently developed. Though these technologies differ in strategy and mode of immunolabeling and detection tags, they commonly utilize antibodies directed against protein biomarkers to provide detailed spatial and functional maps of complex tissues. As these promising antibody-based multiplexing approaches become more widely adopted, new frameworks and considerations are critical for training future users, generating molecular tools, validating antibody panels, and harmonizing datasets. In this Perspective, we provide essential resources, key considerations for obtaining robust and reproducible imaging data, and specialized knowledge from domain experts and technology developers.},

To take full advantage of these two emerging datasets we need a framework that links them, revealing how collective neural activity arises from the structure of neural connectivity and intrinsic neural dynamics. This problem of structure-driven activity has drawn major interest in computational neuroscience. Existing methods for relating activity and architecture in spiking networks rely on linearizing activity around a central operating point and thus fail to capture the nonlinear responses of individual neurons that are the hallmark of neural information processing. Here, we overcome this limitation and present a new relationship between connectivity and activity in networks of nonlinear spiking neurons by developing a diagrammatic fluctuation expansion based on statistical field theory. We explicitly show how recurrent network structure produces pairwise and higher-order correlated activity, and how nonlinearities impact the networks’ spiking activity. Our findings open new avenues to investigating how single-neuron nonlinearities—including those of different cell types—combine with connectivity to shape population activity and function.},

While this variability is presumed to arise from overlapping synaptic input, its precise relationship to local circuit architecture remains unclear. We combine computational models and in vivo recordings to study the relationship between the spatial structure of connectivity and correlated variability in neural circuits. Extending the theory of networks with balanced excitation and inhibition, we find that spatially localized lateral projections promote weakly correlated spiking, but broader lateral projections produce a distinctive spatial correlation structure: nearby neuron pairs are positively correlated, pairs at intermediate distances are negatively correlated and distant pairs are weakly correlated. This non-monotonic dependence of correlation on distance is revealed in a new analysis of recordings from superficial layers of macaque primary visual cortex. Our findings show that incorporating distance-dependent connectivity improves the extent to which balanced network theory can explain correlated neural variability.},

This structure is shaped, in part, by synaptic plasticity that promotes or suppresses connections between neurons depending on their joint spiking activity. Frequently, theoretical studies focus on how feedforward inputs drive plasticity to create this network structure. We study the complementary scenario of self-organized structure in a recurrent network, with spike timing-dependent plasticity driven by spontaneous dynamics. We develop a self-consistent theory for the evolution of network structure by combining fast spiking covariance with a slow evolution of synaptic weights. Through a finite-size expansion of network dynamics we obtain a low-dimensional set of nonlinear differential equations for the evolution of two-synapse connectivity motifs. With this theory in hand, we explore how the form of the plasticity rule drives the evolution of microcircuits in cortical networks. When potentiation and depression are in approximate balance, synaptic dynamics depend on weighted divergent, convergent, and chain motifs. For additive, Hebbian STDP these motif interactions create instabilities in synaptic dynamics that either promote or suppress the initial network structure. Our work provides a consistent theoretical framework for studying how spiking activity in recurrent networks interacts with synaptic plasticity to determine network structure.},

Later work showed that, under some connectivity structures, balanced networks can produce larger correlations between some neuron pairs, even when the average correlation is very small. All of these previous studies assume that the local network receives feedforward synaptic input from a population of uncorrelated spike trains. We show that when spike trains providing feedforward input are correlated, the downstream recurrent network produces much larger correlations.

   abstract = {Cortical neurons recorded in vivo exhibit highly variable responses to the repeated presentation of the same stimulus. To further understand the cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we performed intracellular recordings from neurons in cat striate cortex in vivo and examined the relationships between spontaneous activity and visually evoked responses. Activity was assessed on a trial-by-trial basis by measuring the membrane potential (V(m)) fluctuations and spike activity during brief epochs immediately before and after the onset of an evoked response. We found that the response magnitude, expressed as a change in V(m) relative to baseline, was linearly correlated with the preceding spontaneous V(m). This correlation was enhanced when the cells were hyperpolarized to reduce the activation of voltage-gated conductances. The output of the cells, expressed as spike counts and latencies, was only moderately correlated with fluctuations in the preceding spontaneous V(m). Spike-triggered averaging of V(m) revealed that visually evoked action potentials arise from transient depolarizations having a rise time of ~10 msec. Consistent with this, evoked spike count was found to be linearly correlated with the magnitude of V(m) fluctuations in the γ (20-70 Hz) frequency band. We also found that the threshold of visually evoked action potentials varied over a range of ~10 mV. Examination of simultaneously recorded intracellular and extracellular activity revealed a correlation between V(m) depolarization and spike discharges in adjacent cells. Together these results demonstrate that response variability is attributable largely to coherent fluctuations in cortical activity preceding the onset of a stimulus, but also to variations in action potential threshold and the magnitude of high-frequency fluctuations evoked by the stimulus.},

They also provide an analytical base for perturbative approaches that treat important biological details, such as synaptic filtering, synaptic conductance increase, and voltage-activated currents. Steady-state firing rates of both linear and nonlinear integrate-and-fire models, receiving fluctuating synaptic drive, can be calculated from the time-independent Fokker-Planck equation. The dynamic firing-rate response is less easy to extract, even at the first-order level of a weak modulation of the model parameters, but is an important determinant of neuronal response and network stability. For the linear integrate-and-fire model the response to modulations of current-based synaptic drive can be written in terms of hypergeometric functions. For the nonlinear exponential and quadratic models no such analytical forms for the response are available. Here it is demonstrated that a rather simple numerical method can be used to obtain the steady-state and dynamic response for both linear and nonlinear models to parameter modulation in the presence of current-based or conductance-based synaptic fluctuations. To complement the full numerical solution, generalized analytical forms for the high-frequency response are provided. A special case is also identified-time-constant modulation-for which the response to an arbitrarily strong modulation can be calculated exactly. © 2007 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Spike correlations between neurons are ubiquitous in the cortex, but their role is not understood. Here we describe the firing response of a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron (LIF) when it receives a temporarily correlated input generated by presynaptic correlated neuronal populations. Input correlations are characterized in terms of the firing rates, Fano factors, correlation coefficients, and correlation timescale of the neurons driving the target neuron. We show that the sum of the presynaptic spike trains cannot be well described by a Poisson process. In fact, the total input current has a nontrivial two-point correlation function described by two main parameters: the correlation timescale (how precise the input correlations are in time) and the correlation magnitude (how strong they are). Therefore, the total current generated by the input spike trains is not well described by a white noise gaussian process. Instead, we model the total current as a colored gaussian process with the same mean and two-point correlation function, leading to the formulation of the problem in terms of a Fokker-Planck equation. Solutions of the output firing rate are found in the limit of short and long correlation timescales. The solutions described here expand and improve on our previous results (Moreno, de la Rocha, Renart, & Parga, 2002) by presenting new analytical expressions for the output firing rate for general IF neurons, extending the validity of the results for arbitrarily large correlation magnitude, and by describing the differential effect of correlations on the mean-driven or noise-dominated firing regimes. Also the details of this novel formalism are given here for the first time. We employ numerical simulations to confirm the analytical solutions and study the firing response to sudden changes in the input correlations. We expect this formalism to be useful for the study of correlations in neuronal networks and their role in neural processing and information transmission. © 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

   abstract = {Novel experimental techniques reveal the simultaneous activity of larger and larger numbers of neurons. As a result there is increasing interest in the structure of cooperative - or correlated - activity in neural populations, and in the possible impact of such correlations on the neural code. A fundamental theoretical challenge is to understand how the architecture of network connectivity along with the dynamical properties of single cells shape the magnitude and timescale of correlations. We provide a general approach to this problem by extending prior techniques based on linear response theory. We consider networks of general integrate-and-fire cells with arbitrary architecture, and provide explicit expressions for the approximate cross-correlation between constituent cells. These correlations depend strongly on the operating point (input mean and variance) of the neurons, even when connectivity is fixed. Moreover, the approximations admit an expansion in powers of the matrices that describe the network architecture. This expansion can be readily interpreted in terms of paths between different cells. We apply our results to large excitatory-inhibitory networks, and demonstrate first how precise balance - or lack thereof - between the strengths and timescales of excitatory and inhibitory synapses is reflected in the overall correlation structure of the network. We then derive explicit expressions for the average correlation structure in randomly connected networks. These expressions help to identify the important factors that shape coordinated neural activity in such networks. © 2012 Trousdale et al.},

As shown by comparison with numerical simulations, our theory works well for arbitrary network size if the feedback is weak and the amount of external noise does not exceed that of the internal noise. By means of our analytical results we discuss the quality of the correlation-induced oscillation in a large network as a function of the transmission delay and the internal noise intensity. It is shown that the strongest oscillation is obtained in a system with zero internal noise and adiabatically long delay (i.e., the delay period is longer than any other time scale in the system).

To answer this question, we probed synaptic connections with several hundred simultaneous quadruple whole-cell recordings from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the rat visual cortex. Analysis of this dataset revealed several nonrandom features in synaptic connectivity. We confirmed previous reports that bidirectional connections are more common than expected in a random network. We found that several highly clustered three-neuron connectivity patterns are overrepresented, suggesting that connections tend to cluster together. We also analyzed synaptic connection strength as defined by the peak excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude. We found that the distribution of synaptic connection strength differs significantly from the Poisson distribution and can be fitted by a lognormal distribution. Such a distribution has a heavier tail and implies that synaptic weight is concentrated among few synaptic connections. In addition, the strengths of synaptic connections sharing pre- or postsynaptic neurons are correlated, implying that strong connections are even more clustered than the weak ones. Therefore, the local cortical network structure can be viewed as a skeleton of stronger connections in a sea of weaker ones. Such a skeleton is likely to play an important role in network dynamics and should be investigated further. © 2005 Song et al.},

However, the physiological mechanisms that underlie these changes are not fully understood. We review recent theoretical results that identify three separate mechanisms that modulate spike train correlations: changes in input correlations, internal fluctuations and the transfer function of single neurons. We first examine these mechanisms in feedforward pathways and then show how the same approach can explain the modulation of correlations in recurrent networks.

   abstract = {Correlations in spike-train ensembles can seriously impair the encoding of information by their spatio-temporal structure. An inevitable source of correlation in finite neural networks is common presynaptic input to pairs of neurons. Recent studies demonstrate that spike correlations in recurrent neural networks are considerably smaller than expected based on the amount of shared presynaptic input. Here, we explain this observation by means of a linear network model and simulations of networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We show that inhibitory feedback efficiently suppresses pairwise correlations and, hence, population-rate fluctuations, thereby assigning inhibitory neurons the new role of active decorrelation. We quantify this decorrelation by comparing the responses of the intact recurrent network (feedback system) and systems where the statistics of the feedback channel is perturbed (feedforward system). Manipulations of the feedback statistics can lead to a significant increase in the power and coherence of the population response. In particular, neglecting correlations within the ensemble of feedback channels or between the external stimulus and the feedback amplifies population-rate fluctuations by orders of magnitude. The fluctuation suppression in homogeneous inhibitory networks is explained by a negative feedback loop in the one-dimensional dynamics of the compound activity. Similarly, a change of coordinates exposes an effective negative feedback loop in the compound dynamics of stable excitatory-inhibitory networks. The suppression of input correlations in finite networks is explained by the population averaged correlations in the linear network model: In purely inhibitory networks, shared-input correlations are canceled by negative spike-train correlations. In excitatory-inhibitory networks, spike-train correlations are typically positive. Here, the suppression of input correlations is not a result of the mere existence of correlations between excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons, but a consequence of a particular structure of correlations among the three possible pairings (EE, EI, II). © 2012 Tetzlaff et al.},

   abstract = {To build a catalog of peptides presented by breast cancer cells, we undertook systematic MHC class I immunoprecipitation followed by elution of MHC class I-loaded peptides in breast cancer cells. We determined the sequence of 3196 MHC class I ligands representing 1921 proteins from a panel of 20 breast cancer cell lines. After removing duplicate peptides, i.e., the same peptide eluted from more than one cell line, the total number of unique peptides was 2740. Of the unique peptides eluted, more than 1750 had been previously identified, and of these, sixteen have been shown to be immunogenic. Importantly, half of these immunogenic peptides were shared between different breast cancer cell lines. MHC class I binding probability was used to plot the distribution of the eluted peptides in accordance with the binding score for each breast cancer cell line. We also determined that the tested breast cancer cells presented 89 mutation-containing peptides and peptides derived from aberrantly translated genes, 7 of which were shared between four or two different cell lines. Overall, the high throughput identification of MHC class I-loaded peptides is an effective strategy for systematic characterization of cancer peptides, and could be employed for design of multi-peptide anticancer vaccines. Significance: By employing proteomic analyses of eluted peptides from breast cancer cells, the current study has built an initial HLA-I-typed antigen collection for breast cancer research. It was also determined that immunogenic epitopes can be identified using established cell lines and that shared immunogenic peptides can be found in different cancer types such as breast cancer and leukemia. Importantly, out of 3196 eluted peptides that included duplicate peptides in different cells 89 peptides either contained mutation in their sequence or were derived from aberrant translation suggesting that mutation-containing epitopes are on the order of 2–3% in breast cancer cells. Finally, our results suggest that interfering with MHC class I function is one of the mechanisms of how tumor cells escape immune system attack.},

   abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is a complex disease with primary or acquired incurability characteristics in a significant part of patients. Immunotherapeutical agents represent an emerging option for breast cancer treatment, including the human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (HER2+) subtype. The immune system holds the ability to spontaneously implement a defensive response against HER2+ BC cells through complex mechanisms which can be exploited to modulate this response for obtaining a clinical benefit. Initial immune system modulating strategies consisted mostly in vaccine therapies, which are still being investigated and improved. However, the entrance of trastuzumab into the scenery of HER2+ BC treatment was the real game changing event, which embodied a dominant immune-mediated mechanism. More recently, the advent of the immune checkpoint inhibitors has caused a new paradigm shift for immuno-oncology, with promising initial results also for HER2+ BC. Breast cancer has been traditionally considered poorly immunogenic, being characterized by relatively low tumor mutation burden (TMB). Nevertheless, recent evidence has revealed high tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in a considerable proportion of HER2+ BC patients. This may translate into a higher potential to elicit anti-cancer response and, therefore, wider possibilities for the use and implementation of immunotherapy in this subset of BC patients. We are herein presenting and critically discussing the most representative evidence concerning immunotherapy in HER2+ BC cancer, both singularly and in combination with therapeutic agents acting throughout HER2-block, immune checkpoint inhibition and anti-cancer vaccines. The reader will be also provided with hints concerning potential future projection of the most promising immutherapeutic agents and approaches for the disease of interest.},

   abstract = {Melanoma metastases can be categorized by gene expression for the presence of a T-cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment, which correlates with clinical efficacy of immunotherapies. T cells frequently recognize mutational antigens corresponding to nonsynonymous somatic mutations (NSSMs), and in some cases shared differentiation or cancer-testis antigens. Therapies are being pursued to trigger immune infiltration into non-T-cell-inflamed tumors in the hope of rendering them immunotherapy responsive. However, whether those tumors express antigens capable of T-cell recognition has not been explored. To address this question, 266 melanomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were categorized by the presence or absence of a T-cell-inflamed gene signature. These two subsets were interrogated for cancer-testis, differentiation, and somatic mutational antigens. No statistically significant differences were observed, including density of NSSMs. Focusing on hypothetical HLA-A2+ binding scores, 707 peptides were synthesized, corresponding to all identified candidate neoepitopes. No differences were observed in measured HLA-A2 binding between inflamed and noninflamed cohorts. Twenty peptides were randomly selected from each cohort to evaluate priming and recognition by human CD8+ T cells in vitro with 25% of peptides confirmed to be immunogenic in both. A similar gene expression profile applied to all solid tumors of TCGA revealed no association between T-cell signature and NSSMs. Our results indicate that lack of spontaneous immune infiltration in solid tumors is unlikely due to lack of antigens. Strategies that improve T-cell infiltration into tumors may therefore be able to facilitate clinical response to immunotherapy once antigens become recognized.},

We thus develop an unsupervised alignment method (Celligner) and apply it to integrate several large-scale cell line and tumor RNA-Seq datasets. Although our method aligns the majority of cell lines with tumor samples of the same cancer type, it also reveals large differences in tumor similarity across cell lines. Using this approach, we identify several hundred cell lines from diverse lineages that present a more mesenchymal and undifferentiated transcriptional state and that exhibit distinct chemical and genetic dependencies. Celligner could be used to guide the selection of cell lines that more closely resemble patient tumors and improve the clinical translation of insights gained from cell lines.},

In addition to cell types described in previous single cell studies of early stage lung cancer, we are able to identify rare cell types in tumors such as follicular dendritic cells and T helper 17 cells. Tumors from different patients display large heterogeneity in cellular composition, chromosomal structure, developmental trajectory, intercellular signaling network and phenotype dominance.

   abstract = {The population activity of random networks of excitatory and inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons has been studied extensively. In particular, a state of asynchronous activity with low firing rates and low pairwise correlations emerges in sparsely connected networks. We apply linear response theory to evaluate the influence of detailed network structure on neuron dynamics. It turns out that pairwise correlations induced by direct and indirect network connections can be related to the matrix of direct linear interactions. Furthermore, we study the influence of the characteristics of the neuron model. Interpreting the reset as self-inhibition, we examine its influence, via the spectrum of single-neuron activity, on network autocorrelation functions and the overall correlation level. The neuron model also affects the form of interaction kernels and consequently the time-dependent correlation functions. We find that a linear instability of networks with Erdös-Rényi topology coincides with a global transition to a highly correlated network state. Our work shows that recurrent interactions have a profound impact on spike train statistics and provides tools to study the effects of specific network topologies. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {The expression profiles and spatial distributions of RNAs regulate many cellular functions. Image-based transcriptomic approaches provide powerful means to measure both expression and spatial information of RNAs in individual cells within their native environment. Among these approaches, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) has achieved spatially resolved RNA quantification at transcriptome scale by massively multiplexing single-molecule FISH measurements. Here, we increased the gene throughput of MERFISH and demonstrated simultaneous measurements of RNA transcripts from ∼10,000 genes in individual cells with ∼80% detection efficiency and ∼4% misidentification rate. We combined MERFISH with cellular structure imaging to determine subcellular compartmentalization of RNAs. We validated this approach by showing enrichment of secretome transcripts at the endoplasmic reticulum, and further revealed enrichment of long noncoding RNAs, RNAs with retained introns, and a subgroup of protein-coding mRNAs in the cell nucleus. Leveraging spatially resolved RNA profiling, we developed an approach to determine RNA velocity in situ using the balance of nuclear versus cytoplasmic RNA counts. We applied this approach to infer pseudotime ordering of cells and identified cells at different cell-cycle states, revealing ∼1,600 genes with putative cell cycle-dependent expression and a gradual transcription profile change as cells progress through cell-cycle stages. Our analysis further revealed cell cycle-dependent and cell cycle-independent spatial heterogeneity of transcriptionally distinct cells. We envision that the ability to perform spatially resolved, genome-wide RNA profiling with high detection efficiency and accuracy by MERFISH could help address a wide array of questions ranging from the regulation of gene expression in cells to the development of cell fate and organization in tissues.},

   abstract = {The main reason why tumours are not controlled by the immune system is that, unlike pathogens, they do not express potent tumour rejection antigens (TRAs). Tumour vaccination aims at stimulating a systemic immune response targeted to, mostly weak, antigens expressed in the disseminated tumour lesions. Main challenges in developing effective vaccination protocols are the identification of potent and broadly expressed TRAs and effective adjuvants to stimulate a robust and durable immune response. Here we describe an alternative approach in which the expression of new, and thereby potent, antigens are induced in tumour cells by inhibiting nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay (NMD). Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition of NMD in tumour cells led to the expression of new antigenic determinants and their immune-mediated rejection. In subcutaneous and metastatic tumour models, tumour-targeted delivery of NMD factor-specific siRNAs conjugated to oligonucleotide aptamer ligands led to significant inhibition of tumour growth that was superior to that of vaccination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-expressing irradiated tumour cells, and could be further enhanced by co-stimulation. Tumour-targeted NMD inhibition forms the basis of a simple, broadly useful, and clinically feasible approach to enhance the antigenicity of disseminated tumours leading to their immune recognition and rejection. The cell-free chemically synthesized oligonucleotide backbone of aptamer-siRNAs reduces the risk of immunogenicity and enhances the feasibility of generating reagents suitable for clinical use. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type and HLA expression of tumor cell lines, characterizations necessary for the development of cancer vaccines, have remained largely incomplete and, such information, when available, has been distributed in many publications. Here, we determine the 4-digit HLA type and HLA expression of 167 cancer and 10 non-cancer cell lines from publically available RNA-Seq data. We use standard NGS RNA-Seq short reads from "whole transcriptome" sequencing, map reads to known HLA types, and statistically determine HLA type, heterozygosity, and expression. First, we present previously unreported HLA Class I and II genotypes. Second, we determine HLA expression levels in each cancer cell line, providing insights into HLA downregulation and loss in cancer. Third, using these results, we provide a fundamental cell line "barcode" to track samples and prevent sample annotation swaps and contamination. Fourth, we integrate the cancer cell-line specific HLA types and HLA expression with available cell-line specific mutation information and existing HLA binding prediction algorithms to make a catalog of predicted antigenic mutations in each cell line.

Mechanistically, we find that loss of the Elf5-regulated ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 ensures stabilization of its putative protein substrate IFN-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) at the protein level in TNBC. Elf5low tumours show enhanced IFN-γ signalling accompanied by an increase of immunosuppressive neutrophils within the tumour microenvironment and increased programmed death ligand 1 expression. Inactivation of either programmed death ligand 1 or IFNGR1 elicited a robust anti-tumour and/or anti-metastatic effect.

With an increased understanding of tumor immune surveillance, immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment strategy for breast cancer, despite historically being thought of as an immunologically silent neoplasm. Some types of cancer, such as melanoma, bladder, and renal cell carcinoma, have demonstrated a durable response to immunotherapeutic intervention, however, breast neoplasms have not shown the same efficacy. The causes of breast cancer's immune silence derive from mechanisms that diminish immune recognition and others that promote strong immunosuppression. It is the mechanisms of immune evasion in breast cancers that are poorly defined. Thus, further characterization is critical for the development of better therapies. This brief review will seek to provide insight into the possible causes of weak immunogenicity and immune suppression mediated by breast cancers and highlight current immunotherapies being used to restore immune responses to breast cancer.},

   abstract = {Metastatic breast cancer remains challenging to treat, and most patients ultimately progress on therapy. This acquired drug resistance is largely due to drug-refractory sub-populations (subclones) within heterogeneous tumors. Here, we track the genetic and phenotypic subclonal evolution of four breast cancers through years of treatment to better understand how breast cancers become drug-resistant. Recurrently appearing post-chemotherapy mutations are rare. However, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing reveal acquisition of malignant phenotypes after treatment, including enhanced mesenchymal and growth factor signaling, which may promote drug resistance, and decreased antigen presentation and TNF-α signaling, which may enable immune system avoidance. Some of these phenotypes pre-exist in pre-treatment subclones that become dominant after chemotherapy, indicating selection for resistance phenotypes. Post-chemotherapy cancer cells are effectively treated with drugs targeting acquired phenotypes. These findings highlight cancer's ability to evolve phenotypically and suggest a phenotype-targeted treatment strategy that adapts to cancer as it evolves.},

   abstract = {Deducing the structure of neural circuits is one of the central problems of modern neuroscience. Recently-introduced calcium fluorescent imaging methods permit experimentalists to observe network activity in large populations of neurons, but these techniques provide only indirect observations of neural spike trains, with limited time resolution and signal quality. In this work we present a Bayesian approach for inferring neural circuitry given this type of imaging data. We model the network activity in terms of a collection of coupled hidden Markov chains, with each chain corresponding to a single neuron in the network and the coupling between the chains reflecting the network's connectivity matrix. We derive a Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization algorithm for fitting the model parameters; to obtain the sufficient statistics in a computationally-efficient manner, we introduce a specialized blockwise-Gibbs algorithm for sampling from the joint activity of all observed neurons given the observed fluorescence data. We perform large-scale simulations of randomly connected neuronal networks with biophysically realistic parameters and find that the proposed methods can accurately infer the connectivity in these networks given reasonable experimental and computational constraints. In addition, the estimation accuracy may be improved significantly by incorporating prior knowledge about the sparseness of connectivity in the network, via standard L1 penalization methods. © 2013 Institute of Mathematical Statistics.},

Sanity estimates expression values and associated error bars directly from raw unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts without any tunable parameters. Using simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, we show that Sanity outperforms other normalization methods on downstream tasks, such as finding nearest-neighbor cells and clustering cells into subtypes. Moreover, we show that by systematically overestimating the expression variability of genes with low expression and by introducing spurious correlations through mapping the data to a lower-dimensional representation, other methods yield severely distorted pictures of the data.},

Recently, there has been increasing interest in whether or not the intermediate representations offered by these modules may be used to explain the reasoning for a model's prediction, and consequently reach insights regarding the model's decision-making process. A recent paper claims that 'Attention is not Explanation' (Jain and Wallace, 2019). We challenge many of the assumptions underlying this work, arguing that such a claim depends on one's definition of explanation, and that testing it needs to take into account all elements of the model. We propose four alternative tests to determine when/whether attention can be used as explanation: a simple uniform-weights baseline; a variance calibration based on multiple random seed runs; a diagnostic framework using frozen weights from pretrained models; and an end-to-end adversarial attention training protocol. Each allows for meaningful interpretation of attention mechanisms in RNN models. We show that even when reliable adversarial distributions can be found, they don't perform well on the simple diagnostic, indicating that prior work does not disprove the usefulness of attention mechanisms for explainability.},

The second is that, for the important case of large networks with excitatory-inhibitory balance, correlated spiking persists or vanishes depending on the spatial scales of recurrent and feedforward connectivity. We close by showing how these ideas, together with plasticity rules, can help to close the loop between network structure and activity statistics.},

Here using improved single-molecule RNA microscopy, we show that synthesis of HIV-1 RNA is achieved by groups of closely spaced polymerases, termed convoys, as opposed to single isolated enzymes. Convoys arise by a Mediator-dependent reinitiation mechanism, which generates a transient but rapid succession of polymerases initiating and escaping the promoter. During elongation, polymerases are spaced by few hundred nucleotides, and physical modelling suggests that DNA torsional stress may maintain polymerase spacing. We additionally observe that the HIV-1 promoter displays stochastic fluctuations on two time scales, which we refer to as multi-scale bursting. Each time scale is regulated independently: Mediator controls minute-scale fluctuation (convoys), while TBP-TATA-box interaction controls sub-hour fluctuations (long permissive/non-permissive periods). A cellular promoter also produces polymerase convoys and displays multi-scale bursting. We propose that slow, TBP-dependent fluctuations are important for phenotypic variability of single cells.},

So far, the concept of epigenetic memory has been largely limited to cell-autonomous, preprogrammed processes such as development and metabolism. Here we show that IFNβ stimulation creates transcriptional memory in fibroblasts, conferring faster and greater transcription upon restimulation. The memory was inherited through multiple cell divisions and led to improved antiviral protection. Of ~2,000 IFNβ-stimulated genes (ISGs), about half exhibited memory, which we define as memory ISGs. The rest, designated nonmemory ISGs, did not show memory. Surprisingly, mechanistic analysis showed that IFN memory was not due to enhanced IFN signaling or retention of transcription factors on the ISGs. We demonstrated that this memory was attributed to accelerated recruitment of RNA polymerase II and transcription/chromatin factors, which coincided with acquisition of the histone H3.3 and H3K36me3 chromatin marks on memory ISGs. Similar memory was observed in bone marrow macrophages after IFNγ stimulation, suggesting that IFN stimulation modifies the shape of the innate immune response. Together, external signals can establish epigenetic memory in mammalian cells that imparts lasting adaptive performance upon various somatic cells.},

Many potential mechanistic models have been proposed to account for enhancer-promoter communication, including the formation of the condensed enhancer-promoter clusterings that may result from liquid-liquid phase separation. However, the detailed kinetic mechanisms by which condensates may mediate enhancer-promoter contacts remain unclear. Here, we characterized enhancer-promoter communication in condensates using a self-avoiding polymer chain model under several possible spatial constraints. When the chain was confined to the spherical surface or interior, we discovered a distinct relationship between average end-to-end distance and contour length, as well as a distinct distribution of end-to-end distance. Experimental molecular tracking data showed strong preference in support of the spherical surface confinement hypothesis. Based on such observation, we proposed a novel enhancer-promoter communication model in which enhancers dynamically “kiss” promoters along the surface of transcriptional condensate. The theoretical results may guide future experiments, as researchers continue to elucidate the regulation dynamics of gene expression. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

We implement a binding model in which HP1 preferentially binds to trimethylated histone tails and then oligomerizes to bridge together nucleosomes.

Here, we present a systematic Bayesian approach to multiple-hypothesis testing of a general set of competing motion models based on particle mean-square displacements that automatically classifies particle motion, properly accounting for sampling limitations and correlated noise while appropriately penalizing model complexity according to Occam's Razor to avoid over-fitting. We test the procedure rigorously using simulated trajectories for which the underlying physical process is known, demonstrating that it chooses the simplest physical model that explains the observed data. Further, we show that computed model probabilities provide a reliability test for the downstream biological interpretation of associated parameter values. We subsequently illustrate the broad utility of the approach by applying it to disparate biological systems including experimental particle trajectories from chromosomes, kinetochores, and membrane receptors undergoing a variety of complex motions. This automated and objective Bayesian framework easily scales to large numbers of particle trajectories, making it ideal for classifying the complex motion of large numbers of single molecules and cells from high-throughput screens, as well as single-cell-, tissue-, and organism-level studies. © 2012 by the Biophysical Society.},

While residue-specific phosphorylation has been mapped with exquisite spatial resolution along the 1D genome in a population of fixed cells using immunoprecipitation-based assays, the timing, kinetics, and spatial organization of phosphorylation along a single-copy gene have not yet been measured in living cells. Here, we achieve this by combining multi-color, single-molecule microscopy with fluorescent antibody-based probes that specifically bind to different phosphorylated forms of endogenous RNAP2 in living cells. Applying this methodology to a single-copy HIV-1 reporter gene provides live-cell evidence for heterogeneity in the distribution of RNAP2 along the length of the gene as well as Serine 5 phosphorylated RNAP2 clusters that remain separated in both space and time from nascent mRNA synthesis. Computational models determine that 5 to 40 RNAP2 cluster around the promoter during a typical transcriptional burst, with most phosphorylated at Serine 5 within 6 seconds of arrival and roughly half escaping the promoter in ~1.5 minutes. Taken together, our data provide live-cell support for the notion of efficient transcription clusters that transiently form around promoters and contain high concentrations of RNAP2 phosphorylated at Serine 5.},

   abstract = {Despite substantial experimental and computational efforts, mechanistic modeling remains more predictive in engineering than in systems biology. The reason for this discrepancy is not fully understood. One might argue that the randomness and complexity of biological systems are the main barriers to predictive understanding, but these issues are not unique to biology. Instead, we hypothesize that the specific shapes of rare single-molecule event distributions produce substantial yet overlooked challenges for biological models. We demonstrate why modern statistical tools to disentangle complexity and stochasticity, which assume normally distributed fluctuations or enormous datasets, do not apply to the discrete, positive, and nonsymmetric distributions that characterize mRNA fluctuations in single cells. As an example, we integrate single-molecule measurements and advanced computational analyses to explore mitogen-activated protein kinase induction of multiple stress response genes. Through systematic analyses of different metrics to compare the same model to the same data, we elucidate why standard modeling approaches yield nonpredictive models for single-cell gene regulation. We further explain how advanced tools recover precise, reproducible, and predictive understanding of transcription regulation mechanisms, including gene activation, polymerase initiation, elongation, mRNA accumulation, spatial transport, and decay.},

Here we present a polymer-physics-based approach (PRISMR) to model 3D chromatin folding and to predict enhancer-promoter contacts. PRISMR predicts higher-order chromatin structure from genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. Using the EPHA4 locus as a model, the effects of pathogenic SVs are predicted in silico and compared to Hi-C data generated from mouse limb buds and patient-derived fibroblasts. PRISMR deconvolves the folding complexity of the EPHA4 locus and identifies SV-induced ectopic contacts and alterations of 3D genome organization in homozygous or heterozygous states. We show that SVs can reconfigure topologically associating domains, thereby producing extensive rewiring of regulatory interactions and causing disease by gene misexpression. PRISMR can be used to predict interactions in silico, thereby providing a tool for analyzing the disease-causing potential of SVs.},

For the estrogen receptor (ER), a ligand-dependent activator, we show that estrogen enhances phase separation with Mediator, again linking phase separation with gene activation.

In this study, we investigate chromatin dynamics by statistically analyzing single-nucleosome movement in living human cells. Bimodal nature of the mean square displacement distribution of nucleosomes allows for a natural categorization of the nucleosomes as fast and slow. Analyses of the nucleosome–nucleosome correlation functions within these categories along with the density of vibrational modes show that the nucleosomes form dynamically correlated fluid regions (i.e., dynamic domains of fast and slow nucleosomes). Perturbed nucleosome dynamics by global histone acetylation or cohesin inactivation indicate that nucleosome–nucleosome interactions along with tethering of chromatin chains organize nucleosomes into fast and slow dynamic domains. A simple polymer model is introduced, which shows the consistency of this dynamic domain picture. Statistical analyses of single-nucleosome movement provide rich information on how chromatin is dynamically organized in a fluid manner in living cells.},

Patients resistant to these therapies commonly have molecular aberrations in the IFNγ signalling pathway or express resistance molecules driven by IFNγ. Given that all nucleated cells can respond to IFNγ, the functional consequences of IFNγ production need to be carefully dissected on a cell-by-cell basis.

Therefore, characterizing stochastic effects in biochemical systems is essential to understand the complex dynamics of living things. Mathematical idealizations of biochemically reacting systems must be able to capture stochastic phenomena. While robust theory exists to describe such stochastic models, the computational challenges in exploring these models can be a significant burden in practice since realistic models are analytically intractable. Determining the expected behaviour and variability of a stochastic biochemical reaction network requires many probabilistic simulations of its evolution. Using a biochemical reaction network model to assist in the interpretation of time-course data from a biological experiment is an even greater challenge due to the intractability of the likelihood function for determining observation probabilities. These computational challenges have been subjects of active research for over four decades. In this review, we present an accessible discussion of the major historical developments and state-of-the-art computational techniques relevant to simulation and inference problems for stochastic biochemical reaction network models. Detailed algorithms for particularly important methods are described and complemented with Matlabw implementations. As a result, this review provides a practical and accessible introduction to computational methods for stochastic models within the life sciences community.},

   abstract = {Stochastic reaction network models are often used to explain and predict the dynamics of gene regulation in single cells. These models usually involve several parameters, such as the kinetic rates of chemical reactions, that are not directly measurable and must be inferred from experimental data. Bayesian inference provides a rigorous probabilistic framework for identifying these parameters by finding a posterior parameter distribution that captures their uncer-tainty. Traditional computational methods for solving inference problems such as Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on the classical Metropolis-Hastings algorithm involve numerous serial evaluations of the likelihood function, which in turn requires expensive forward solutions of the chemical master equation (CME). We propose an alternate approach based on a multifidelity extension of the sequential tempered Markov chain Monte Carlo (ST-MCMC) sam-pler. This algorithm is built upon sequential Monte Carlo and solves the Bayesian inference problem by decomposing it into a sequence of efficiently solved subproblems that gradually increase both model fidelity and the influence of the observed data. We reformulate the finite state projection (FSP) algorithm, a well-known method for solving the CME, to produce a hierarchy of surrogate master equations to be used in this multifidelity scheme. To determine the appro-priate fidelity, we introduce a novel information-theoretic criterion that seeks to extract the most information about the ultimate Bayesian posterior from each model in the hierarchy without inducing significant bias. This novel sampling scheme is tested with high-performance computing resources using biologically relevant problems.},

We find that, although ongoing transcription and local chromatin signatures are short-lived, the IFNγ-primed state stably propagates through at least 14 cell division cycles. Single-cell analysis reveals that memory is manifested by an increased probability of primed cells to engage in target gene expression, correlating with the strength of initial gene activation. Further, we find that strongly memorized genes tend to reside in genomic clusters and that long-term memory of these genes is locally restricted by cohesin. We define the duration, stochastic nature, and molecular mechanisms of IFNγ-induced transcriptional memory, relevant to understanding enhanced innate immune signaling.},

Reconstitution with BRG1, but not an ATPase-deficient version of this protein (K798R), rescued CIITA induction, and enhanced the rate of induction of the IFN-γ-responsive GBP-1 gene. Notably, BRG1 inhibited the CIITA promoter in transient transfection assays, underscoring the importance of an appropriate chromosomal environment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that BRG1 interacts directly with the endogenous CIITA promoter in an IFN-γ-inducible fashion, while in vivo DNase I footprinting and restriction enzyme accessibility assays showed that chromatin remodeling at this locus requires functional BRG1.

Recent experimental high-throughput techniques, such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) provide important information about the architecture of the regulatory networks in the cell. However, it is very difficult to measure the concentration levels of transcription factor proteins and determine their regulatory effect on gene transcription. It is therefore an important computational challenge to infer these quantities using gene expression data and network architecture data. Results: We develop a probabilistic state space model that allows genome-wide inference of both transcription factor protein concentrations and their effect on the transcription rates of each target gene from microarray data. We use variational inference techniques to learn the model parameters and perform posterior inference of protein concentrations and regulatory strengths. The probabilistic nature of the model also means that we can associate credibility intervals to our estimates, as well as providing a tool to detect which binding events lead to significant regulation. We demonstrate our model on artificial data and on two yeast datasets in which the network structure has previously been obtained using ChIP data. Predictions from our model are consistent with the underlying biology and offer novel quantitative insights into the regulatory structure of the yeast cell. © 2006 Oxford University Press.},

However, using single-molecule imaging we find that CTCF binds chromatin much more dynamically than cohesin (~1-2 min vs. ~22 min residence time). Moreover, after unbinding, CTCF quickly rebinds another cognate site unlike cohesin for which the search process is long (~1 min vs. ~33 min). Thus, CTCF and cohesin form a rapidly exchanging ’dynamic complex’ rather than a typical stable complex. Since CTCF and cohesin are required for loop domain formation, our results suggest that chromatin loops are dynamic and frequently break and reform throughout the cell cycle.},

IFN triggers drastic changes in cellular transcriptomes, executed by JAK-STAT signal transduction and the transcriptional control of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) by STAT transcription factors. Here, we study the immediate-early nuclear response to IFN-I and IFN-γ in murine macrophages. We show that the mechanism of gene control by both cytokines includes a rapid increase of DNA accessibility and rearrangement of the 3D chromatin contacts particularly between open chromatin of ISG loci. IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), the major transcriptional regulator of ISG, controlled homeostatic and, most notably, induced-state DNA accessibility at a subset of ISG. Increases in DNA accessibility correlated with the appearance of activating histone marks at surrounding nucleosomes. Collectively our data emphasize changes in the three-dimensional nuclear space and epigenome as an important facet of transcriptional control by the IFN-induced JAK-STAT pathway.},

Recent advances in super-resolution microscopy have made it possible to measure chromatin 3D structure and transcription in thousands of single cells.

Here, we present a deep learning-based approach to better understand to what degree chromatin structure relates to transcriptional state of individual cells. Furthermore, we explore methods to “unpack the black box” to determine in an unbiased manner which structural features of chromatin regulation are most important for gene expression state. We apply this approach to an Optical Reconstruction of Chromatin Architecture dataset of the Bithorax gene cluster in Drosophila and show it outperforms previous contact-focused methods in predicting expression state from 3D structure. We find the structural information is distributed across the domain, overlapping and extending beyond domains identified by prior genetic analyses.

Our interest is particularly focused on the role played by phase separation in the formation of molecule aggregates that can join distant regulatory elements, such as gene promoters and enhancers, along the DNA. We find that the overall equilibrium state of the system resulting from the mutual interplay between binding molecules and chromatin can lead, under suitable conditions that depend on molecules concentration, molecule-molecule, and molecule-DNA interactions, to the formation of phase-separated molecular clusters, allowing robust contacts between regulatory sites. Vice versa, the presence of regulatory sites can promote the phase-separation process. Different dynamical regimes can generate the enhancer-promoter contact, either by cluster nucleation at binding sites or by bulk spontaneous formation of the mediating cluster to which binding sites are successively attracted. The possibility that such processes can explain experimental live-cell imaging data measuring distances between regulatory sites during time is also discussed.},

However, the events that lead to pIV activation are only partially understood, and the point at which BRG1 acts is unknown. The first IFN-induced event triggers nuclear translocation of STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1), which binds IFN-responsive promoters. BRG1 is recruited after activator binding at several other inducible loci, and STAT family members are known to bind BRG1, suggesting that BRG1 might act downstream of STAT1. Here, we delineate a comprehensive view of factor assembly and detailed histone modifications at pIV and show that all events, even STAT1 binding, require BRG1 at CIITA pIV and other IFN-target promoters. Recruitment of IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3) [STAT1STAT2IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9)] to several IFN-responsive promoters is also BRG1-dependent. In contrast, constitutive BRG1 association at IFN targets is STAT1-independent. Furthermore, BRG1 is required for IFN-induced restriction enzyme and DNase I accessibility at promoters.

Hallmarks of immunosuppression are already detectable in precursor regions. When tumors become locally invasive, a consolidated and spatially restricted suppressive environment forms along the tumor-stromal boundary. This environment is established by cytokine gradients that promote expression of MHC-II and IDO1, and by PD1-PDL1-mediated cell contacts involving macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells.

By illuminating the complex interplay between chromatin and various chromatin-interacting molecular species mediated by phase separation, this review sheds light on an emerging multi-scale, multi-modal and multi-faceted landscape that hierarchically regulates the genome within the highly crowded and dynamic nuclear space. Moreover, deficiencies in existing studies also highlight the need for mechanism-specific criteria and multi-parametric approaches for the characterization of chromatin-based phase separation using complementary techniques and call for greater efforts to correlate the quantitative features of these condensates with their functional consequences in close-to-native cellular contexts.},

Results: Modelling the photoswitching behaviour of a fluorophore as an unobserved continuous time Markov process transitioning between a single fluorescent and multiple dark states, and fully mitigating for missed blinks and false positives, we present a method for computing the exact probability distribution for the number of observed localizations from a single photoswitching fluorophore. This is then extended to provide the probability distribution for the number of localizations in a direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy experiment involving an arbitrary number of molecules. We demonstrate that when training data are available to estimate photoswitching rates, the unknown number of molecules can be accurately recovered from the posterior mode of the number of molecules given the number of localizations. Finally, we demonstrate the method on experimental data by quantifying the number of adapter protein linker for activation of T cells on the cell surface of the T-cell immunological synapse.},

Recent advances in this technique have greatly accelerated the data acquisition speed and improved the temporal resolution of super-resolution imaging. However, it has not been quantified whether this speed increase comes at the cost of compromised image quality. The spatial and temporal resolution depends on many factors, among which laser intensity and camera speed are the two most critical parameters. Here we quantitatively compare the image quality achieved when imaging Alexa Fluor 647-immunolabeled microtubules over an extended range of laser intensities and camera speeds using three criteria-localization precision, density of localized molecules, and resolution of reconstructed images based on Fourier Ring Correlation. We found that, with optimized parameters, singlemolecule switching nanoscopy at high speeds can achieve the same image quality as imaging at conventional speeds in a 5-25 times shorter time period. Furthermore, we measured the photoswitching kinetics of Alexa Fluor 647 from single-molecule experiments, and, based on this kinetic data, we developed algorithms to simulate single-molecule switching nanoscopy images. We used this software tool to demonstrate how laser intensity and camera speed affect the density of active fluorophores and influence the achievable resolution. Our study provides guidelines for choosing appropriate laser intensities for imaging Alexa Fluor 647 at different speeds and a quantification protocol for future evaluations of other probes and imaging parameters.},

Inspired by these observations, we use a copolymer model to investigate how $F$ affects the dynamical properties of a single chromatin. The movements of the loci in the gene-rich region are suppressed in an intermediate range of $F$, and are enhanced at small and large $F$ values. In the intermediate $F$, the bond length between consecutive loci increases, becoming commensurate with the location of the minimum in the attractive interaction between the active loci. This results in a transient disorder-to-order transition, leading to the decreased mobility during transcription. Transient ordering of the loci in the gene-rich region might be a mechanism for nucleating a dynamic network involving transcription factors, RNAPII, and chromatin.},

Interestingly, while LH proteins alone decrease long-range contacts and acetylation alone increases transient contacts, combined LH and acetylation produce long-range contacts.

Of particular interest is a regime where protein droplets only form due to interaction with the polymer; here, unlike a standard phase separating system, droplet density rather than size varies with the overall protein concentration.

Our contributions are a novel network architecture for simultaneous detection and localization, and new loss function which phrases detection and localization as a Bayesian inference problem, and thus allows the network to provide uncertainty-estimates. In contrast to standard methods which independently process imaging frames, our network architecture uses temporal context from multiple sequentially imaged frames to detect and localize molecules. We demonstrate the power of our method across a variety of datasets, imaging modalities, signal to noise ratios, and fluorophore densities. While existing localization algorithms can achieve optimal localization accuracy at low fluorophore densities, they are confounded by high densities. Our method is the first deep-learning based approach which achieves state-of-the-art on the SMLM2016 challenge. It achieves the best scores on 12 out of 12 data-sets when comparing both detection accuracy and precision, and excels at high densities. Finally, we investigate how unsupervised learning can be used to make the network robust against mismatch between simulated and real data.

However, particularly for localization in 3D, analytical functions such as a Gaussian, which are computationally inexpensive, may not accurately capture the PSF shape leading to reduced fitting accuracy. On the other hand, analytical functions that can accurately capture the PSF shape, such as those based on pupil functions, can be computationally expensive. Here we investigate the use of cubic splines as an alternative fitting approach. We demonstrate that cubic splines can capture the shape of any PSF with high accuracy and that they can be used for fitting the PSF with only a 2-3x increase in computation time as compared to Gaussian fitting.

The algorithm, which is implemented in a simple web interface and in a standalone package reproduces with high computational efficiency the structural landscape of long segments of DNA untreatable by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.},

   abstract = {We consider the problem of single-molecule identification in superresolution microscopy. Super-resolution microscopy overcomes the diffraction limit by localizing individual fluorescing molecules in a field of view. This is particularly difficult since each individual molecule appears and disappears randomly across time and because the total number of molecules in the field of view is unknown. Additionally, data sets acquired with superresolution microscopes can contain a large number of spurious fluorescent fluctuations caused by background noise. To address these problems, we present a Bayesian nonparametric framework capable of identifying individual emitting molecules in super-resolved time series. We tackle the localization problem in the case in which each individual molecule is already localized in space. First, we collapse observations in time and develop a fast algorithm that builds upon the Dirichlet process. Next, we augment the model to account for the temporal aspect of fluorophore photophysics. Finally, we assess the performance of our methods with ground-truth data sets having known biological structure.},

For a binary trait, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain closed-form analytic solutions for the probability mass and probability generating functions of this evolutionary counting process.

These superresolution microscopy techniques are based on detecting optically isolated, fluorescently tagged anti-histone antibodies, fluorescently labeled DNa precursor analogs, or fluorescent dyes bound to DNa. Presently they suffer from various drawbacks such as low labeling efficiency or interference with DNa structure. In this report, we demonstrate that DNa minor groove binding dyes, such as Hoechst 33258, Hoechst 33342, and DaPI, can be effectively employed in single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) with high optical and structural resolution. Upon illumination with low intensity 405 nm light, a small subpopulation of these molecules stochastically undergoes photoconversion from the original blue-emitting form to a green-emitting form. Using a 491 nm laser excitation, fluorescence of these green-emitting, optically isolated molecules was registered until "bleached". This procedure facilitated substantially the optical isolation and localization of large numbers of individual dye molecules bound to DNa in situ, in nuclei of fixed mammalian cells, or in mitotic chromosomes, and enabled the reconstruction of high-quality DNa density maps. We anticipate that this approach will provide new insights into DNa replication, DNa repair, gene transcription, and other nuclear processes. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.},

   abstract = {The rapid development of scientific CMOS (sCMOS) technology has greatly advanced optical microscopy for biomedical research with superior sensitivity, resolution, field-of-view, and frame rates. However, for sCMOS sensors, the parallel charge-voltage conversion and different responsivity at each pixel induces extra readout and pattern noise compared to charge-coupled devices (CCD) and electron-multiplying CCD (EM-CCD) sensors. This can produce artifacts, deteriorate imaging capability, and hinder quantification of fluorescent signals, thereby compromising strategies to reduce photo-damage to live samples. Here, we propose a content-adaptive algorithm for the automatic correction of sCMOS-related noise (ACsN) for fluorescence microscopy. ACsN combines camera physics and layered sparse filtering to significantly reduce the most relevant noise sources in a sCMOS sensor while preserving the fine details of the signal. The method improves the camera performance, enabling fast, low-light and quantitative optical microscopy with video-rate denoising for a broad range of imaging conditions and modalities.},

For speed, the algorithm is implemented on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) architecture, resulting in analysis times on the order of minutes.

   abstract = {Metazoan genomes are spatially organized at multiple scales, from packaging of DNA around individual nucleosomes to segregation of whole chromosomes into distinct territories. At the intermediate scale of kilobases to megabases, which encompasses the sizes of genes, gene clusters and regulatory domains, the three-dimensional (3D) organization of DNA is implicated in multiple gene regulatory mechanisms, but understanding this organization remains a challenge. At this scale, the genome is partitioned into domains of different epigenetic states that are essential for regulating gene expression. Here we investigate the 3D organization of chromatin in different epigenetic states using super-resolution imaging. We classified genomic domains in Drosophila cells into transcriptionally active, inactive or Polycomb-repressed states, and observed distinct chromatin organizations for each state. All three types of chromatin domains exhibit power-law scaling between their physical sizes in 3D and their domain lengths, but each type has a distinct scaling exponent. Polycomb-repressed domains show the densest packing and most intriguing chromatin folding behaviour, in which chromatin packing density increases with domain length. Distinct from the self-similar organization displayed by transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin, the Polycomb-repressed domains are characterized by a high degree of chromatin intermixing within the domain. Moreover, compared to inactive domains, Polycomb-repressed domains spatially exclude neighbouring active chromatin to a much stronger degree. Computational modelling and knockdown experiments suggest that reversible chromatin interactions mediated by Polycomb-group proteins play an important role in these unique packaging properties of the repressed chromatin. Taken together, our super-resolution images reveal distinct chromatin packaging for different epigenetic states at the kilobase-to-megabase scale, a length scale that is directly relevant to genome regulation.},

These distinct structural characteristics are also observed in mitotic chromosomes. Furthermore, active histone marks coincide with less compact chromatin and exhibit a higher degree of co-localization with other active marks and RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), while repressive marks coincide with densely packed chromatin and spatially distant from repressive marks and active RNAP II.

Improved understanding of the roles that super-enhancers play in biology would be afforded by knowing the constellation of factors that constitute these domains and by identifying super-enhancers across the spectrum of human cell types. We describe here the population of transcription factors, cofactors, chromatin regulators, and transcription apparatus occupying super-enhancers in embryonic stem cells and evidence that super-enhancers are highly transcribed. We produce a catalog of super-enhancers in a broad range of human cell types and find that super-enhancers associate with genes that control and define the biology of these cells. Interestingly, disease-associated variation is especially enriched in the super-enhancers of disease-relevant cell types. Furthermore, we find that cancer cells generate super-enhancers at oncogenes and other genes important in tumor pathogenesis.

   abstract = {<p>Condensation by phase separation has recently emerged as a mechanism underlying many nuclear compartments essential for cellular functions. Nuclear condensates enrich nucleic acids and proteins, localize to specific genomic regions, and often promote gene expression. How diverse properties of nuclear condensates are shaped by gene organization and activity is poorly understood. Here, we develop a physics-based model to interrogate how spatially-varying transcription activity impacts condensate properties and dynamics. Our model predicts that spatial clustering of active genes can enable precise localization and de novo nucleation of condensates. Strong clustering and high activity results in aspherical condensate morphologies. Condensates can flow towards distant gene clusters and competition between multiple clusters lead to stretched morphologies and activity-dependent repositioning. Overall, our model predicts and recapitulates morphological and dynamical features of diverse nuclear condensates and offers a unified mechanistic framework to study the interplay between non-equilibrium processes, spatially-varying transcription, and multicomponent condensates in cell biology.</p>},

   abstract = {The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine has attracted enormous interest in mental health research owing to its rapid antidepressant actions, but its mechanism of action has remained elusive. Here we show that blockade of NMDAR-dependent bursting activity in the 'anti-reward center', the lateral habenula (LHb), mediates the rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine in rat and mouse models of depression. LHb neurons show a significant increase in burst activity and theta-band synchronization in depressive-like animals, which is reversed by ketamine. Burst-evoking photostimulation of LHb drives behavioural despair and anhedonia. Pharmacology and modelling experiments reveal that LHb bursting requires both NMDARs and low-voltage-sensitive T-type calcium channels (T-VSCCs). Furthermore, local blockade of NMDAR or T-VSCCs in the LHb is sufficient to induce rapid antidepressant effects. Our results suggest a simple model whereby ketamine quickly elevates mood by blocking NMDAR-dependent bursting activity of LHb neurons to disinhibit downstream monoaminergic reward centres, and provide a framework for developing new rapid-acting antidepressants.},

   abstract = {We present a hidden Markov model analysis for fluorescent time series of quantum dots. A fundamental quantity to measure optical performance of the quantum dots is a distribution function for the light-emission duration. So far, to estimate it, a threshold value for the fluorescent intensity was introduced, and the light-emission state was evaluated as a state above the threshold. With this definition, the light-emission duration was estimated, and its distribution function was derived as a blinking plot. Due to the noise in the fluorescent data, however, this treatment generates a large number of artificially short-lived emission states, thus leading to an erroneous blinking plot. In the present paper, we propose a hidden Markov model to eliminate these artifacts. The hidden Markov model introduces a hidden variable specifying the light-emission and quenching states behind the observed fluorescence. We found that it is possible to avoid the above artifacts by identifying the state from the hidden-variable time series. We found that, from the analysis of experimental and theoretical benchmark data, the accuracy of our hidden Markov model is beyond human cognitive ability.},

   abstract = {The bromodomain protein Brd4 regulates the transcription of signal-inducible genes. This is achieved by recruiting the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb to promoters by its P-TEFb interaction domain (PID). Here we show that Brd4 stimulates the kinase activity of P-TEFb for phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II over basal levels. The CTD phosphorylation saturation levels, the preferences for pre-phosphorylated substrates, and the phosphorylation specificity for Ser5 of the CTD however remain unchanged. Inhibition of P-TEFb by Hexim1 is relieved by Brd4, although no mutual displacement with the Cyclin T-binding domain of Hexim1 was observed. Brd4 PID shows a surprising sequence motif similarity to the trans-activating Tat protein from HIV-1, which includes a core RxL motif, a polybasic cluster known as arginine-rich motif, and a C-terminal leucine motif. Mutation of these motifs to alanine significantly diminished the stimulatory effect of Brd4 and fully abrogated its activation potential in presence of Hexim1. Yet the protein was not found to bind Cyclin T1 as Tat, but only P-TEFb with a dissociation constant of 0.5 μM. Our data suggest a model where Brd4 acts on the kinase subunit of P-TEFb to relieve inhibition and stimulate substrate recognition. © The Author(s) 2014.

The bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family of proteins consists of four conserved mammalian members (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT) that regulate the expression of many immunity-associated genes and pathways. In particular, in response to infection and sterile inflammation, abnormally expressed or dysfunctional BETs are involved in the activation of pattern recognition receptor (e.g., TLR, NLR, and CGAS) pathways, thereby linking chromatin machinery to innate immunity under disease or pathological conditions. Mechanistically, the BET family controls the transcription of a wide range of proinflammatory and immunoregulatory genes by recognizing acetylated histones (mainly H3 and H4) and recruiting transcription factors (e.g., RELA) and transcription elongation complex (e.g., P-TEFb) to the chromatin, thereby promoting the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II and subsequent transcription initiation and elongation. This review covers the accumulating data about the roles of the BET family in innate immunity, and discusses the attractive prospect of manipulating the BET family as a new treatment for disease.},

We demonstrated that nucleosomes form compact domains with a peak diameter of ∼160 nm and move coherently in live cells. The heterochromatin-rich regions showed more domains and less movement. With cell differentiation, the domains became more apparent, with reduced dynamics. Furthermore, various perturbation experiments indicated that they are organized by a combination of factors, including cohesin and nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. Notably, we observed the domains during mitosis, suggesting that they act as building blocks of chromosomes and may serve as information units throughout the cell cycle.},

In contrast to photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) with photoactivatable fluorescent proteins, dSTORM experiments start with bright fluorescent samples in which the fluorophores have to be transferred to a stable and reversible OFF state. The OFF state has a lifetime in the range of 100 milliseconds to several seconds after irradiation with light intensities low enough to ensure minimal photodestruction. Either spontaneously or photoinduced on irradiation with a second laser wavelength, a sparse subset of fluorophores is reactivated and their positions are precisely determined. Repetitive activation, localization and deactivation allow a temporal separation of spatially unresolved structures in a reconstructed image. Here we present a step-by-step protocol for dSTORM imaging in fixed and living cells on a wide-field fluorescence microscope, with standard fluorescent probes focusing especially on the photoinduced fine adjustment of the ratio of fluorophores residing in the ON and OFF states. Furthermore, we discuss labeling strategies, acquisition parameters, and temporal and spatial resolution.

   abstract = { Many components of eukaryotic transcription machinery—such as transcription factors and cofactors including BRD4, subunits of the Mediator complex, and RNA polymerase II—contain intrinsically disordered low-complexity domains. Now a conceptual framework connecting the nature and behavior of their interactions to their functions in transcription regulation is emerging (see the Perspective by Plys and Kingston). Chong et al. found that low-complexity domains of transcription factors form concentrated hubs via functionally relevant dynamic, multivalent, and sequence-specific protein-protein interaction. These hubs have the potential to phase-separate at higher concentrations. Indeed, Sabari et al. showed that at super-enhancers, BRD4 and Mediator form liquid-like condensates that compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus to maintain expression of key cell-identity genes. Cho et al. further revealed the differential sensitivity of Mediator and RNA polymerase II condensates to selective transcription inhibitors and how their dynamic interactions might initiate transcription elongation.

Here we demonstrate that the SE-enriched transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 form nuclear puncta at SEs that exhibit properties of liquid-like condensates and are disrupted by chemicals that perturb condensates. The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase-separated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts. These results support the idea that coactivators form phase-separated condensates at SEs that compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus, suggest a role for coactivator IDRs in this process, and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell-identity genes.},

The median number of nucleosomes inside clutches and their compaction defined as nucleosome density were cell-type-specific. Ground-state pluripotent stem cells had, on average, less dense clutches containing fewer nucleosomes and clutch size strongly correlated with the pluripotency potential of induced pluripotent stem cells.

   abstract = {We describe a simple illumination method of fluorescence microscopy for molecular imaging. Illumination by a highly inclined and thin beam increases image intensity and decreases background intensity, yielding a signal/background ratio about eightfold greater than that of epi-illumination. A high ratio yielded clear single-molecule images and three-dimensional images using cultured mammalian cells, enabling one to visualize and quantify molecular dynamics, interactions and kinetics in cells for molecular systems biology. Much progress in single-molecule techniques has provided a new and direct approach to study molecular mechanisms 1-9 in recent years. Real-time imaging of single fluorescent molecules in aqueous solution was achieved by refining epifluorescence microscopy 4,5 and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) 4,6. As TIRF illuminates only surface areas 10 , it has been used to visualize single molecules in vitro 11. Furthermore, single-molecule imaging with objective-type TIRF 6 allowed researchers to observe individual molecules on the cell surface 12,13. However, the application of TIRF is limited to surfaces. To overcome this limitation, here we describe an approach, called highly inclined and laminated optical sheet (HILO) microscopy for single-molecule imaging inside cells. The main technical challenge of single-molecule fluorescence imaging is increasing the signal/background ratio. We achieved notable success in this by inclining the illumination beam and by minimizing the illumination area. The incident laser beam is highly inclined by a large refraction and is laminated as a thin optical sheet at the specimen side (Fig. 1a,b). In HILO microscopy, this thin optical sheet is used for illumination. Its thickness dz along the z-direction is roughly dz ¼ R/tany, which is the thickness of the geometrical optics not including the divergence, where R is the diameter of the illuminated area at the specimen plane, and y is the incidence angle at the specimen (Fig. 1b). When R/tany is less than a few tens of micrometers, divergence increases the thickness dz by more than the value obtained by the calculation above. To reduce the divergence of illumination at the specimen, we incorporated a field stop for the illumination beam into the incident light path to be conjugate with the specimen plane. The image of the field stop is formed at the specimen plane so that the divergence of the illumination at the edge of the field-stop image is minimized (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b online). One of the features of HILO microscopy is that the illumination beam always passes through the center of the specimen plane (Supplementary Fig. 1c-f), which means the illumination beam follows the z-directional shift of the specimen plane. This feature is powerful for three-dimensional imaging.

BRD4 puncta are correlated with BRD4S but not BRD4L expression levels. BRD4S knockdown reduces BRD4S condensation, and ectopic expression promotes puncta formation and target gene transcription. BRD4S nuclear condensation is mediated by its intrinsically disordered regions and binding of its bromodomains to DNA and acetylated chromatin, respectively, and BRD4S phosphorylation diminishes BRD4 condensation. Our study illuminates a previously unappreciated role of BRD4S in organizing chromatin and transcription factors through phase separation to sustain gene transcription in chromatin for cancer cell proliferation.},

We report that BRD4 is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that acetylates histones H3 and H4 with a pattern distinct from those of other HATs. Both mouse and human BRD4 have intrinsic HAT activity. Importantly, BRD4 acetylates H3 K122, a residue critical for nucleosome stability, thus resulting in nucleosome eviction and chromatin decompaction. Nucleosome clearance by BRD4 occurs genome wide, including at its targets MYC, FOS and AURKB (Aurora B kinase), resulting in increased transcription. These findings suggest a model wherein BRD4 actively links chromatin structure and transcription: it mediates chromatin decompaction by acetylating and evicting nucleosomes at target genes, thereby activating transcription.},

So far, successful efforts have been limited to chromatin modifying enzymes, or so-called epigenetic 'writers' and 'erasers'. Potent inhibitors of histone binding modules have not yet been described. Here we report a cell-permeable small molecule (JQ1) that binds competitively to acetyl-lysine recognition motifs, or bromodomains. High potency and specificity towards a subset of human bromodomains is explained by co-crystal structures with bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family member BRD4, revealing excellent shape complementarity with the acetyl-lysine binding cavity. Recurrent translocation of BRD4 is observed in a genetically-defined, incurable subtype of human squamous carcinoma. Competitive binding by JQ1 displaces the BRD4 fusion oncoprotein from chromatin, prompting squamous differentiation and specific antiproliferative effects in BRD4-dependent cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. These data establish proof-of-concept for targeting protein-protein interactions of epigenetic 'readers', and provide a versatile chemical scaffold for the development of chemical probes more broadly throughout the bromodomain family. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

In paired cell lines selected for acquired resistance to BET inhibition from previously sensitive TNBCs, we failed to identify gatekeeper mutations, new driver events or drug pump activation. BET-resistant TNBC cells remain dependent on wild-type BRD4, which supports transcription and cell proliferation in a bromodomain-independent manner.

Via interaction screen and domain mapping, we identified p53 as a functional partner of Brd4. Interestingly, Brd4 association with p53 is modulated by casein kinase II (CK2)-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved acidic region in Brd4 that selectively contacts either a juxtaposed bromodomain or an adjacent basic region to dictate the ability of Brd4 binding to chromatin and also the recruitment of p53 to regulated promoters.

However, the molecular mechanism that regulates the assembly of higher-order chromatin structure remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that Brd4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4) protein participates in the maintenance of the higher-order chromatin structure. Brd4, a member of the BET family of proteins, has been shown to play important roles in cellular growth control, cell cycle progression, and cancer development. We apply in situ single cell chromatin imaging and micrococcal nuclease (MNase) assay to show that Brd4 depletion leads to a large scale chromatin unfolding.Adominant-negative inhibitor encoding the double bromodomains (BDI/II) of Brd4 can competitively dissociate endogenous Brd4 from chromatin to trigger severely fragmented chromatin morphology. Mechanistic studies using Brd4 truncation mutants reveal that the Brd4 C-terminal domain is crucial for maintaining normal chromatin structure. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation technology, we demonstrate that Brd4 molecules interact intermolecularly on chromatin and that replacing Brd4 molecules by BDI/II causes abnormal nucleosome aggregation and chromatin fragmentation.

This motion mode appeared to change beyond this time scale. A defined genomic region also behaved similarly. Combined with Brownian dynamics model-ing, our results suggest that this steady-state chromatin motion was mainly driven by thermal fluctuations.

RNAPII inhibition or its rapid depletion released the chromatin constraints and increased chromatin dynamics. Perturbation experiments of P-TEFb clusters, which are associated with active RNAPII, had similar results. Furthermore, chromatin mobility also increased in resting G0 cells and UV-irradiated cells, which are transcriptionally less active. Our results demonstrated that chromatin is globally stabilized by loose connections through active RNAPII, which is compatible with models of classical transcription factories or liquid droplet formation of transcription-related factors.

   abstract = {The X-ray crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle of chromatin shows in atomic detail how the histone protein octamer is assembled and how 146 base pairs of DNA are organized into a superhelix around it. Both histone/histone and histone/DNA interactions depend on the histone fold domains and additional, well ordered structure elements extending from this motif. Histone amino-terminal tails pass over and between the gyres of the DNA superhelix to contact neighbouring particles. The lack of uniformity between multiple histone/DNA-binding sites causes the DNA to deviate from ideal superhelix geometry. DNA in chromatin is organized in arrays of nucleosomes 1. Two copies of each histone protein, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, are assembled into an octamer that has 145-147 base pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around it to form a nucleosome core (of relative molecular mass 206K). This highly conserved nucleoprotein complex occurs essentially every 200 40 bp throughout all eukaryotic genomes 2. The repeating nucleosome cores further assemble into higher-order structures which are stabilized by the linker histone H1 and these compact linear DNA overall by a factor of 30-40. The nucleosome (nucleosome core, linker DNA and H1) thereby shapes the DNA molecule both at the atomic level through DNA bending, and on the much larger scale of genes by forming higher-order helices 3. The nucleosome, in its role as the principal packaging element of DNA within the nucleus, is the primary determinant of DNA accessibility. The physical properties of nucleosomes depend on solution conditions such as ionic strength, divalent-ion concentration, and on histone-modification state 4. For example, the variability of nucleosome spacing within in vitro-assembled arrays demonstrates the underlying electrostatic component of the interaction of DNA with the basic histone proteins 5. The characteristics of an individual nucleosome, however, depend on the actual DNA sequence incorporated , and this can have functional significance for specific gene promoters 6. Positioning of nucleosomes along the DNA molecule is in part governed by DNA sequence preferences, but once formed, a nucleosome may not be entirely fixed in position 7. The statistical preference observed for the DNA minor groove to face the histone octamer at (A þ T)-rich sequences indicates that certain sequences will impart a rotational orientation to the DNA double helix when bound in a nucleosome 8. The variation in this preference along the length of nucleosomal DNA and the intrinsic sequence-dependent bendability of DNA implies that strong translational settings can also occur. Both types of positioning have been detected with base-pair accuracy in the mouse mammary-tumour virus long terminal repeat 9. Recombination, replication, mitotic condensation and transcription involve the chromatin substrate and are thus affected by its structure. The generally repressive nature of chromatin structure has long been appreciated in transcription regulation 10. Chromatin organization can facilitate the activation of specific genes 11,12. Evidence supporting two themes is accumulating. First, histones collaborate with transcription factors to provide for their own removal or structural modification, resulting in gene derepression. This may occur by stepwise invasion of DNA-binding proteins entering at the terminal segments of the nucleosomal DNA 13. This mechanism is apparently insufficient in general, however, because several ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling factors have been discovered that cause the core histones partially to lose or alter their grip on DNA 14. Second, the bending and supercoiling of DNA on a nucleosome can promote binding of transcription factors and augment interactions between different factors 15,16. The structure of a nucleosome core particle, crystallized under physiologically relevant ionic conditions 17 , was previously solved by X-ray crystallography at 7 A ˚ resolution 18. This low-resolution structure confirmed the disc-like shape of the particle deduced from earlier studies 19 which results from the flat, left-handed superhelical arrangement of the DNA. The path of the DNA superhelix was irregular, bending tightly at several positions and being nearly straight in others. Although detailed side-chain information or atomic coordinates are not available, the re-interpreted, high-salt, histone octamer crystal structure, for which the histone fold was first described 20 , allowed more accurate assignment of the secondary structure of the histone proteins in the core particle at low resolution 21. We have determined the high-resolution X-ray structure of the nucleosome core particle from new crystals which have all components individually made in bacteria and assembled after purification. These crystals, containing DNA of defined sequence and histones lacking post-translational modifications 22,23 , diffract aniso-tropically to between 1.8-2.2 A ˚. Recombinant histone proteins enabled heavy-atom derivatives to be prepared through the substitution of cysteine at many sites. Use of an ESRF undulator beam line allowed accurate measurement of the weak diffraction intensities from these crystals and yielded a high-quality electron density map. The structure presented here is currently refined to 2.8 A ˚ resolution, and includes an entire 146-bp DNA molecule and over 80% of the eight histone chains. Some portions of the N-and C-terminal histone-tail regions extending outside the confines of a single particle have not been included in the atomic model. Organization of the nucleosome core particle The 146 bp of DNA are wrapped around the histone octamer in 1.65 turns of a flat, left-handed superhelix (Fig. 1a). Although the human-satellite DNA used was made palindromic to accommodate perfect twofold symmetry, the sequence in fact binds the histone octamer with a central base pair at the particle pseudo-twofold axis so that the DNA is divided into 73-and 72-bp halves, with one base pair falling on the dyad. We define the rotational orientation of the DNA double helix relative to the central base pair (superhelix location zero, or SHL0, where the major groove faces the octamer), and for each successive turn, the location number increases in the 73-bp half up to SHL þ 7, and decreases in the 72-bp half down to SHL 7 (Fig. 1d; only the 73-bp half of the DNA superhelix and associated histone proteins are shown for clarity).

The mitotic chromosomes of the HeLa S3 cells appeared as compact structures with a homogeneous grainy texture, in which there were no visible 30-nm fibers. Power spectra of the chromosome images also gave no indication of 30-nm chromatin folding. These results, together with our observations of the effects of chromosome swelling, strongly suggest that, within the bulk of compact metaphase chromosomes, the nucleosomal fiber does not undergo 30-nm folding, but exists in a highly disordered and interdigitated state, which is, on the local scale, comparable with a polymer melt. chromatin compaction polymer melt chromosome structure vitreous sections contrast transfer function},

Here, we combine these maps with new Hi-C, microscopy, and genome-editing experiments to study the physical structure of chromatin fibers, domains, and loops. We find that the observed contact domains are inconsistent with the equilibrium state for an ordinary condensed polymer. Combining Hi-C data and novel mathematical theorems, we show that contact domains are also not consistent with a fractal globule. Instead, we use physical simulations to study two models of genome folding. In one, intermonomer attraction during polymer condensation leads to formation of an anisotropic "tension globule." In the other, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin act together to extrude unknotted loops during interphase. Both models are consistent with the observed contact domains and with the observation that contact domains tend to form inside loops. However, the extrusion model explains a far wider array of observations, such as why loops tend not to overlap and why the CTCF-binding motifs at pairs of loop anchors lie in the convergent orientation. Finally, we perform 13 genome-editing experiments examining the effect of altering CTCF-binding sites on chromatin folding. The convergent rule correctly predicts the affected loops in every case. Moreover, the extrusion model accurately predicts in silico the 3D maps resulting from each experiment using only the location of CTCF-binding sites in the WT. Thus, we show that it is possible to disrupt, restore, and move loops and domains using targeted mutations as small as a single base pair.},

   abstract = {The organization of interphase chromosomes in a number of species is starting to emerge thanks to advances in a variety of experimental techniques. However, much less is known about the dynamics, especially in the functional states of chromatin. Some experiments have shown that the motility of individual loci in human interphase chromosome decreases during transcription, and increases upon inhibiting transcription. This is a counter-intuitive finding because it is thought that the active mechanical force (F) on the order of ten pico-newtons, generated by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) that is presumably transmitted to the gene-rich region of the chromatin, would render it more open, thus enhancing the mobility. We developed a minimal active copolymer model for interphase chromosomes to investigate how F affects the dynamical properties of chromatin. The movements of the loci in the gene-rich region are suppressed in an intermediate range of F, and are enhanced at small F values, which has also been observed in experiments. In the intermediate F, the bond length between consecutive loci increases, becoming commensurate with the distance at the minimum of the attractive interaction between non-bonded loci. This results in a transient disorder-to-order transition, leading to a decreased mobility during transcription. Strikingly, the F-dependent change in the locus dynamics preserves the organization of the chromosome at F=0. Transient ordering of the loci, which is not found in the polymers with random epigenetic profiles, in the gene-rich region might be a plausible mechanism for nucleating a dynamic network involving transcription factors, RNAPII, and chromatin.},

Certain compartments are associated with specific chromatin regions, including transcriptional initiation condensates, which are composed of transcription factors and transcriptional machinery, and form at acetylated regions including enhancer and promoter loci.

Here, utilizing live-cell experiments in parallel with coarse-grained simulations, we investigate how chromatin interaction of the transcriptional activator BRD4 modulates its condensate formation. We find that both kinetic and thermodynamic properties of BRD4 condensation are affected by chromatin binding: nucleation rate is sensitive to BRD4–chromatin interactions, providing an explanation for the selective formation of BRD4 condensates at acetylated chromatin regions, and thermodynamically, multivalent acetylated chromatin sites provide a platform for BRD4 clustering below the concentration required for off-chromatin condensation. This provides a molecular and physical explanation of the relationship between nuclear condensates and epigenetically modified chromatin that results in their mutual spatiotemporal regulation, suggesting that epigenetic modulation is an important mechanism by which the cell targets transcriptional condensates to specific chromatin loci.},

   abstract = {The coactivator p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) regulates genes by facilitating the assembly of transcriptional machinery and by acetylating histones and other factors. However, it remains mostly unclear how both functions of p300 are dynamically coordinated during gene control. Here, we showed that p300 can orchestrate two functions through the formation of dynamic clusters with certain transcription factors (TFs), which is mediated by the interactions between a TF's transactivation domain (TAD) and the intrinsically disordered regions of p300. Co-condensation can enable spatially defined, all-or-none activation of p300’s catalytic activity, priming the recruitment of coactivators, including Brd4. We showed that co-condensation can modulate transcriptional initiation rate and burst duration of target genes, underlying nonlinear gene regulatory functions. Such modulation is consistent with how p300 might shape gene bursting kinetics globally. Altogether, these results suggest an intriguing gene regulation mechanism, in which TF and p300 co-condensation contributes to transcriptional bursting regulation and cooperative gene control.},

   abstract = {Genes on different chromosomes can be spatially associated in the nucleus in several transcriptional and regulatory situations; however, the functional significance of such associations remains unclear. Using human erythropoiesis as a model, we show that five cotranscribed genes, which are found on four different chromosomes, associate with each other at significant but variable frequencies. Those genes most frequently in association lie in decondensed stretches of chromatin. By replacing the mouse α-globin gene cluster in situ with its human counterpart, we demonstrate a direct effect of the regional chromatin environment on the frequency of association, whereas nascent transcription from the human α-globin gene appears unaffected. We see no evidence that cotranscribed erythroid genes associate at shared transcription foci, but we do see stochastic clustering of active genes around common nuclear SC35-enriched speckles (hence the apparent non-random association between genes). Thus, association between active genes may result from their location on decondensed chromatin that enables clustering around common nuclear speckles. © 2008 Brown et al.},

DSBs are mainly repaired by homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). To repair DSBs, a large amount of DNA repair factors was observed to be concentrated at the end of DSBs in a specific spatiotemporal manner to form a repair center. Recently, this repair center was characterized as a condensate derived from liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of key DSBs repair factors. LLPS has been found to be the mechanism of membraneless organelles formation and plays key roles in a variety of biological processes. In this review, the recent advances and mechanisms of LLPS in the formation of DSBs repair-related condensates are summarized.},

   abstract = {Modulation enhanced single-molecule localization microscopy (meSMLM) methods improve the localization precision by using patterned illumination to encode additional position information. Iterative meSMLM (imeSMLM) methods iteratively generate prior information on emitter positions, used to locally improve the localization precision during subsequent iterations. The Cramér-Rao lower bound cannot incorporate prior information to bound the best achievable localization precision because it requires estimators to be unbiased. By treating estimands as random variables with a known prior distribution, the Van Trees inequality (VTI) can be used to bound the best possible localization precision of imeSMLM methods. An imeSMLM method is considered, where the positions of in-plane standing-wave illumination patterns are controlled over the course of multiple iterations. Using the VTI, we analytically approximate a lower bound on the maximum localization precision of imeSMLM methods that make use of standing-wave illumination patterns. In addition, we evaluate the maximally achievable localization precision for different illumination pattern placement strategies using Monte Carlo simulations. We show that in the absence of background and under perfect modulation, the information content of signal photons increases exponentially as a function of the iteration count. However, the information increase is no longer exponential as a function of the iteration count under non-zero background, imperfect modulation, or limited mechanical resolution of the illumination positioning system. As a result, imeSMLM with two iterations reaches at most a fivefold improvement over SMLM at 8 expected background photons per pixel and 95% modulation contrast. Moreover, the information increase from imeSMLM is balanced by a reduced signal photon rate. Therefore, SMLM outperforms imeSMLM when considering an equal measurement time and illumination power per iteration. Finally, the VTI is an excellent tool for the assessment of the performance of illumination control and is therefore the method of choice for optimal design and control of imeSMLM methods.},

This progress has been facilitated by approaching each fluorophore iteratively with the probing-donut minimum, making the resolution essentially uniform and isotropic over scalable fields of view. MINFLUX imaging of nuclear pore complexes of a mammalian cell shows that this true nanometer-scale resolution is obtained in three dimensions and in two color channels. Relying on fewer detected photons than standard camera-based localization, MINFLUX nanoscopy is poised to open a new chapter in the imaging of protein complexes and distributions in fixed and living cells.},

Several super-resolution methods have been developed over the last decade, all capable of overcoming the fundamental diffraction limit of light. We present here an approach for obtaining subdiffraction limit optical resolution in all three dimensions. This method relies on higher-order statistical analysis of temporal fluctuations (caused by fluorescence blinking/intermittency) recorded in a sequence of images (movie). We demonstrate a 5-fold improvement in spatial resolution by using a conventional wide-field microscope. This resolution enhancement is achieved in iterative discrete steps, which in turn allows the evaluation of images at different resolution levels. Even at the lowest level of resolution enhancement, our method features significant background reduction and thus contrast enhancement and is demonstrated on quantum dot-labeled microtubules of fibroblast cells.},

Here we analyzed the spatio-temporal dynamics of T cell antigen receptor (TCR) complexes and linker for activation of T cells (Lat), a key adaptor molecule in the TCR signaling pathway, in T cell membranes using high-speed photoactivated localization microscopy, dual-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. In quiescent T cells, both molecules existed in separate membrane domains (protein islands), and these domains concatenated after T cell activation. These concatemers were identical to signaling microclusters, a prominent hallmark of T cell activation. This separation versus physical juxtapositioning of receptor domains and domains containing downstream signaling molecules in quiescent versus activated T cells may be a general feature of plasma membrane-associated signal transduction. © 2010 Nature America, Inc.

Because Lck is constitutively active, spatial organization may regulate TCR signaling. Here we found that Lck distributions on the molecular level were controlled by the conformational states of Lck, with the open, active conformation inducing clustering and the closed, inactive conformation preventing clustering. In contrast, association with lipid domains and protein networks were not sufficient or necessary for Lck clustering. Conformation-driven Lck clustering was highly dynamic, so that TCR triggering resulted in Lck clusters that contained phosphorylated TCRs but excluded the phosphatase CD45. Our data suggest that Lck conformational states represent an intrinsic mechanism for the intermolecular organization of early T cell signaling. © 2013 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Monitoring virus assembly at the nanoscale in host cells remains a major challenge. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) components are addressed to the plasma membrane where they assemble to form spherical particles of 100 nm in diameter. Interestingly, HIV-1 Gag protein expression alone is sufficient to produce virus-like particles (VLPs) that resemble the immature virus. Here, we monitored VLP formation at the plasma membrane of host CD4+ T cells using a newly developed workflow allowing the analysis of long duration recordings of single-molecule Gag protein localisation and movement. Comparison of Gag assembling platforms in CD4+ T cells expressing wild type or assembly-defective Gag mutant proteins showed that VLP formation lasts roughly 15 minutes with an assembly time of 5 minutes. Trapping energy maps, built from membrane associated Gag protein movements, showed that one third of the assembling energy is due to direct Gag capsid-capsid interaction while the remaining two thirds require the nucleocapsid-RNA interactions. Finally, we show that the viral RNA genome does not increase the attraction of Gag at the membrane towards the assembling site but rather acts as a spatiotemporal coordinator of the membrane assembly process.},

   abstract = {We propose a new type of scanning fluorescence microscope capable of resolving 35 nm in the far field. We overcome the diffraction resolution limit by employing stimulated emission to inhibit the fluorescence process in the outer regions of the excitation point-spread function. In contrast to near-field scanning optical microscopy, this method can produce three-dimensional images of translucent specimens. Far-field fluorescence light microscopy is a versatile technique for investigating biological specimens. Focused beams are able to penetrate translucent specimens, thus permitting the generation of three-dimensional images of living specimens.' Since the research of Abb6 it has been considered that the resolution limits of light microscopy based on focusing optics had been reached. 2 In a recent study 3 the possibility of overcoming the classical resolution limit by a factor of 2 was shown by use of two-photon exci-tation. In this Letter we show how to increase the resolution by a factor of 4.5 by utilizing stimulated emission. Figure 1 displays the energy levels involved in the excitation and the subsequent emission process of a typical fluorophore. 4 S 0 and S 1 are the ground and the first excited electronic state, respectively. Lo is a low vibrational level of So, and L 1 is the directly excited level of S 1. Similarly, L 2 is the relaxed vibrational level of S 1 , and L 3 is a higher level of So. Figure 2 depicts the setup of our proposed stimulated-emission-depletion (STED) fluorescence scanning microscope. The excitation light generating the Lo-L 1 transition originates from a point source consisting of a laser focused onto a pinhole. The point source is imaged into the specimen by the objective lens. The intensity distribution of the exci-tation light in the focal plane of the lens is determined by diffraction and described by the point-spread function' (PSF) hexc(V) = const.12J 1 (v)/P 1 2. J 1 is the first-order Bessel function, and v = 2i7-r N.A./Aexc is the optical unit in the focal plane. r is the distance from the focal point, N.A. is the numerical aperture, and Aexc is the wavelength of the excitation light. The excitation PSF hexc(P) is indicated on the right-hand side of Fig. 2. hexc(P) quantifies the probability that an excitation photon arrives at v and the spatial extent of hexc(P) determines the resolution of a scanning fluorescence microscope. 5 One possible way to reduce the spatial extent of the hexc(z') is to inhibit the fluorescence in the outer regions of hexc(P). This is equivalent to an increase in resolution. We propose the employment of an additional beam of light, which we call the STED beam, to inhibit fluorescence. In Fig. 2 the STED beam is emitted from a second laser and split into two beams focused with small lateral offsets ± A P with respect to the excitation beam. If the offset is chosen appropriately (3 < APv < 7), the intensity distributions of the STED beams in the focal plane, hsTED(v ± AP'), overlap with the excitation beam on either side. The role of the STED beam is to induce the transition L 2-L3 by stimulated emission and to deplete the excited state before fluorescence takes place. Thus only the innermost region of the main maximum of hexc(V) contributes to the fluorescence signal. The spatial and temporal behaviors of the population probabilities ni(P, t) of the levels Li (i = 0, 1, 2, 3) of the dye are described by a set of coupled differential equations relating the interplay among the absorption, quenching , vibrational relaxation, stimulated emission, and spontaneous emission: dno = hexcool(nl-no) +-n3 dt Tvibr dn, dt dn 2 dt dn 3 dt = hexo-ol(no-n 1)-1 nl, T vibr = n + hSTEDo-23(n3-n 2) T vibr = hSTEDO-23(n2-n3) + (Tfluor L3 Lo Fig. 1.

Because of its highly charged character, the structure of chromatin varies greatly depending on the surrounding environment (i.e. cations etc.): from an extended 10-nm fiber, to a folded 30-nm fiber, to chromatin condensates/liquid-droplets. Over the last ten years, newly developed technologies have drastically shifted our view on chromatin from a static regular structure to a more irregular and dynamic one, locally like a fluid. Since no single imaging (or genomics) method can tell us everything and beautiful images (or models) can fool our minds, comprehensive analyses based on many technical approaches are important to capture actual chromatin organization inside the cell. Here we critically discuss our current view on chromatin and methodology used to support the view.},
