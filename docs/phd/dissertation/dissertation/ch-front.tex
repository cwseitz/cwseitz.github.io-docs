\begin{abstract}%
Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques, such as direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), can be used to produce a pointillist representation of fluorescently-labeled biological structures at diffraction-unlimited precision. Direct STORM approaches leverage the deactivation of standard fluorescent tags, followed by spontaneous or photoinduced reactivation, allowing resolution of fluorophores at distances below the diffraction limit. This basic principle remains one of the method's primary limitations - standard SMLM fitting routines require tight control of activation and reactivation to maintain sparse emitters, presenting a tradeoff between imaging speed and labeling density. Here, I present two parallel projects, which aim to push the current state of the art in SMLM and apply SMLM to the study of gene regulation. The former represents a novel localization technique for dense SMLM, based on deep probabilistic modeling and photon statistics. In the latter, conventional dSTORM is adapted for live cell imaging of chromatin nanodomains, demonstrating that BRD4 protein concentrates in nucleosome depleted regions.
