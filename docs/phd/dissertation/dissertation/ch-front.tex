\begin{abstract}%

Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques, such as direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), can be used to produce a pointillist representation of fluorescently-labeled biological structures at diffraction-unlimited precision. This class of techniques permits localization of fluorescent molecules in the cell with nanometer precision and thus is commonly referred to as \emph{nanoscopy}. Conventional nanoscopy utilizes the deactivation of standard fluorescent tags, followed by spontaneous or photoinduced reactivation, to resolve fluorophores at distances below the diffraction limit. While powerful, this approach has limited throughput and requires localization in sparse scenes. This dissertation introduces fluorescence nanoscopy and covers its innovation and application as discussed in the following papers:

\textit{Quantum enhanced localization microscopy with a single photon avalanche diode array} \parencite{Seitz2024Quantum} leverages recent advancements in single photon avalanche diode array technology to count fluorescent emitters using a widefield microscope. 

\textit{Uncertainty-aware localization microscopy by variational diffusion} \parencite{Seitz2024Uncertainty} describes a novel algorithm that applies a diffusion model in order to model a posterior distribution on high resolution localization microscopy images, given low resolution inputs. 

\textit{BRD4 phosphorylation regulates structure of chromatin nanodomains} \parencite{Seitz2024BRD4} describes the role of the BRD4 phosphoswitch in the maintenance of chromatin nanodomains via super resolution microscopy and molecular dynamics simulation. We demonstrate that BRD4 phosphorylation regulates chromatin packing and mobility in mammalian nuclei.
