\begin{abstract}%

This dissertation introduces single molecule localization microscopy and covers work discussed in the following papers:
“BRD4 phosphorylation state regulates structure of chromatin nanodomains” [1] describes the role of the BRD4 phosphoswitch in the maintenance of chromatin nanodomains via super resolution microscopy and molecular dynamics simulation. We build on the notion that chromatin binding activity of BRD4 is regulated by phosphorylation by demonstrating that BRD4 phosphorylation regulated chromatin packing and mobility in mammalian nuclei.

“Denoising diffusion probabilistic models for blind deconvolution in single molecule localization microscopy” [2] describes an algorithm that leverages a novel paradigm for deep generative modeling using Gaussian diffusions in order to enhance the resolution of localization microscopy images. 

Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques, such as direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), can be used to produce a pointillist representation of fluorescently-labeled biological structures at diffraction-unlimited precision. Direct STORM approaches leverage the deactivation of standard fluorescent tags, followed by spontaneous or photoinduced reactivation, allowing resolution of fluorophores at distances below the diffraction limit. This basic principle remains one of the method's primary limitations - standard SMLM fitting routines require tight control of activation and reactivation to maintain sparse emitters, presenting a tradeoff between imaging speed and labeling density. Here, I present two parallel projects, which aim to push the current state of the art in SMLM and apply SMLM to the study of gene regulation. The former represents a novel localization technique for dense SMLM, based on deep probabilistic modeling and photon statistics. In the latter, conventional dSTORM is adapted for live cell imaging of chromatin nanodomains, demonstrating that BRD4 protein concentrates in nucleosome depleted regions.
