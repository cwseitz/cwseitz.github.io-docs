\section{The Kramers-Moyal Expansion}

Given many instantiations of a stochastic variable $V$, we can construct a normalize histogram over all observations as a function of time $P(V,t)$. However, in order to systematically explore the relationship between the parameterization of the process and $P(V,t)$ we require an expression for $\dot{P}(V,t)$. If we make a fundamental assumption that the evolution of $P(V,t)$ follows a Markov process i.e. its evolution has the memoryless property, then we can write

\begin{equation}
P(V', t) = \int T(V', t | V, t-\tau)P(V, t-\tau)dV
\end{equation} 

which is known at the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. The factor $T(V', t | V, t-\tau)$ is known as the \emph{transition operator} in a Markov process and determines the evolution of $P(V,t)$ in time. We proceed by writing $T(V', t | V, t-\tau)$ in a form referred to as the Kramers-Moyal expansion

\begin{align*}
T(V', t | V, t-\tau) &= \int \delta(u-V')T(u, t | V, t-\tau)du\\
&= \int \delta(V+u-V'-V)T(u, t | V, t-\tau)du\\
\end{align*} 

If we use the Taylor expansion of the $\delta$-function 

\begin{equation*}
\delta(V+u-V'-V) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(u-V)^{n}}{n!}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial V}\right)^{n}\delta(V-V')
\end{equation*}

Inserting this into the result from above, pulling out terms independent of $u$ and swapping the order of the sum and integration gives

\begin{align}
T(V', t | V, t-\tau) &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial V}\right)^{n}\delta(V-V')\int(u-V)^{n}T(u, t | V, t-\tau)du\\
&= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial V}\right)^{n}\delta(V-V')M_{n}(V,t)
\end{align} 

noticing that $M_{n}(V,t) = \int(u-V)^{n}T(u, t | V, t-\tau)du$ is just the $n$th moment of the transition operator $T$. Plugging (2.6) back in to (2.4) gives 

\begin{align}
P(V, t) &= \int \left(1 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial V}\right)^{n} M_{n}(V,t)\right)\delta(V-V')P(V, t-\tau)dV\\
&= P(V', t-\tau) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial V}\right)^{n} \left[M_{n}(V,t)P(V,t)\right]
\end{align} 

Approximating the derivative as a finite difference and taking the limit $\tau\rightarrow 0$ gives

\begin{align}
\dot{P}(V,t)  &= \underset{\tau\rightarrow 0}{\mathrm{lim}}\left(\frac{P(V, t)-P(V, t-\tau)}{\tau}\right)\\
&= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial V}\right)^{n} \left[M_{n}(V,t)P(V,t)\right]
\end{align} 

which is formally known as the Kramers-Moyal (KM) expansion. The Fokker-Planck equation is a special case of (2.10) where we neglect terms $n>2$ in the \emph{diffusion approximation}.
