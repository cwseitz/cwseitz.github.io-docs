%\section{PERSONAL STATEMENT}  

%I research and model changes in chromatin structure after exposure to ionizing radiation and other chemical/biological perturbations

%I maintain a diverse background and specialize in single molecule localization microscopy, statistical/mathematical modeling, and developing machine learning models for computer vision in microscopy. Recently, I have developed deep generative models and analytical probabilistic methods to enhance bioimaging and test hypotheses in genomics/epigenetics.

%I am an optical microscopist and machine learning expert with experience with several imaging modalities including widefield, confocal, single molecule localization microscopy, and selective plane illumination. I also have extensive experience with various image processing techniques for quantification, segmentation, and object detection/tracking.

%I am a microscopist with experience with several imaging modalities including widefield, confocal, single molecule localization microscopy (STORM/PALM), and selective plane illumination. I also have experience in cell biology research, particularly in the field of epigenetics.
