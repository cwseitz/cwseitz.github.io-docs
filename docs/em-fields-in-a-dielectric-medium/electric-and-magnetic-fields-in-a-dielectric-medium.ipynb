    "We know that the electric field is a vector field resulting from the summation of electric fields generated by all charge. Here, I would like two introduce two additional fields: the polarization and displacement fields. The polarization field is another vector field that expresses the density of permanent or induced dipole moments in dielectric material. This field \n",

    "where $\\epsilon_{r}$ is relative permittivity and is related to the vacuum permittivity by $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{r}\\epsilon_{0}$. The intuition here is that for high electric susceptibility, we have a larger polarization density for a given electric field. For this reason, I think of the electric permittivity as how polarized a medium will be for a given applied field. We might expect that, by polarizing the medium, another electric field is created by the induced dipoles and the resulting field is their sum. This is summarized by the displacement field $D$: \n",
