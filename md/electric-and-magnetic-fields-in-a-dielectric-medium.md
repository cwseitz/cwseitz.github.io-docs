# Electric permittivity

We know that the electric field is a vector field resulting from the summation of electric fields generated by all charge. Here, I would like two introduce two additional fields: the polarization and displacement fields. The polarization field is another vector field that expresses the density of permanent or induced dipole moments in dielectric material. This field


\begin{equation*}
P = \epsilon_{0}\chi_{E} E
\end{equation*}

where $\chi$ is the electric suseptibility of the medium and is related to the permittivity by:

\begin{equation*}
\chi_{E} = \epsilon_{r} - 1
\end{equation*}


where $\epsilon_{r}$ is relative permittivity and is related to the vacuum permittivity by $\epsilon = \epsilon_{r}\epsilon_{0}$. The intuition here is that for high electric susceptibility, we have a larger polarization density for a given electric field. For this reason, I think of the electric permittivity as how polarized a medium will be for a given applied field. We might expect that, by polarizing the medium, another electric field is created by the induced dipoles and the resulting field is their sum. This is summarized by the displacement field $D$:

\begin{equation*}
D = \epsilon_{0}E + P = \epsilon E
\end{equation*}

# Magnetic permeability

It is a similar story for the magnetic field. We have a magnetic permeability $\mu = \mu_{r}\mu_{0}$ that represents how magnetized a medium will be given an applied magnetic field. As such, we have

\begin{equation*}
\chi_{M} = \mu_{r} - 1
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
B = \mu_{0}H + M = \mu H
\end{equation*}

Importantly, the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability play a critical role in determining the speed of light and the refractive index for a particular medium

\begin{equation*}
c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu\epsilon}} \rightarrow n = \sqrt{\mu_{r}\epsilon_{r}}
\end{equation*}
