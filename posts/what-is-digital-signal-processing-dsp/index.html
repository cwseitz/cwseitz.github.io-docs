                <h1>Digital Signal Processing (DSP)</h1>
<p>Digital Signal processing or DSP is difficult to define precisely but a working definition might read: DSP is the use of discrete algorithms to modify the information contained within digital signals or to extract valuable features of a digital signal. A digital signal in itself is just a variable that can take on a discrete set of values and can be displayed or manipulated. Digital signals are very common in the modern age and play a central role in telecommunications, biomedical signals, music, video/image, and so on. </p>
<h1>Key DSP Operations</h1>
<p>Most DSP algorithms are based off of four fundamental operations: </p>
<ol>
<li>Convolution</li>
<li>Correlation</li>
<li>Filtering</li>
<li>Discrete Transformations</li>
</ol>
<p>The next four sections are dedicated to the demonstration of these four operations so that they can be used as building blocks for more complex operations. </p>
<h1>Convolution and Filtering</h1>
<p>For a discrete time sequence $x(t)$, its convolution with another discrete time sequence $h(t)$ is defined as:</p>
<p>\begin{equation<em>}
y(t) = x(t)</em>h(t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}x(k)\cdot h(t-k)
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>At first glance, this seems like an arbitrary mathematical operation, but it is very useful in signal processing applications provided we carefully choose the function $h(t)$. Indeed, the function $h(t)$ can be designed so that it acts as a <em>filter</em>, eliminating undesirable signal components. There is an interesting theorem in mathematics called the <em>convolution theorem</em> that states that the convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain. In fact, this relationship between the convolution and frequency domain is why I have merged two seemingly distinct sections on convolution and filtering. We will see that we can filter a digital signal in the time domain by convolution or we can transform to the frequency domain, perform multiplication and transform back to the time domain. </p>
<h1>Correlation</h1>
<p>There are two main types of correlations: autocorrelations and cross-correlations. The former describes the correlation of a digital signal with itself while the latter describes the correlation of two independent signals. </p>
